weirdest thing weve foundi cant really remember what i wa doing but i think i wa digging the garden to plant some sapling but while i wa digging i found a rock with a sharp edge i wa curious about it

the classroom every sunday with my immense rack of a hundred or so marker pressured to draw comparably to the other kid i strained to follow the teacher stepbystep instruction and chose precisely from my wide variety of hue by the end of one week i had drawn what i must say wa a very elegant dolphin with bold black outline and a deep aqua shadei remember the ride home vividly carefully admiring my work i noticed that the paper wa still sodden with my aggressivelyapplied ink that couldnt do i prudently rolled down my window and stuck my portrait out into the windfor a while the dolphin flapped nobly sending ticklish vibration up my arm i laughed at the amusement we rushed over a small bridge the dolphin flailed wildly sharply whipped back and forth back and forth audibly crackling in the wind and then she wa freei did not even see it land despite my plea mother would not pull over ive always assumed since then that my dolphin drifted down slowly gently over the rail of the bridge into that gurgling brook i frequently think about where it could be now there part of me that belief it still there patiently tucked under some stone waiting for me andrew ni princeton njdefinitely the most memorable thing ive lost wa my glass i remember i had taken them off to take a shower a one doe and afterwards when i left the bathroom i forgot to get them eventually i realized i left them and went looking but when i got to the bathroom they werent there after about day of searching every nook and cranny in my house i decided to just give up we even had to move which is when i figured id find them but nope to this day i still have absolutely no clue where they are i joke around whenever i bring it up and say a ghost stole them from me cause they needed to read something but ended up

good with the application of hot sauce i put hot sauce on many thing especially food like rice bean and just about any vegetable although there is much much more there is a bottle of hot sauce at the end of the line in my cafeteria at school and when it is not there i am sad jason s philadelphia pa mastermanmy obsession with the cheese steak began when i wa but a wee lad and had not experienced much in my short life up until that point that day when i wa four year old my life changed and my appetite became fixated on the sandwich sure i would eat other thing but i knew that there wa only one item that could satiate my truest craving i tried all kind of topping pepper hot pepper the list went on but i realized that only one combination of ingredient could ever be the same a that first lifealtering bite that list being a cheese steak with solely meat cheese whiz and onion jonah a masterman schooli think it all started when i wa four or five and my mom and i were eating at a diner in new york i usually ate egg and bacon while my mom ate my leftover since i wa small and the plate wa huge but this time my mom ordered a greek salad she told me to try some because it wa very healthy but i did not like the look of all the different shape in the plate i settled for a round light green object with seed in the middle because we had just learned how to plant seed at my school when i tried it i immediately fell in love with the cucumber i ate every single one off the greek salad and completely forgot about my bacon when i wa year old i wa already perfecting the different way to cut the skin of the cucumber and how to make different shape with the cucumber at year old i would sometimes eat three cucumber a day during the summer tino k masterman philadelphiaxiao long bao consist of a ball of meat usually pork or crab or both and broth inside a dumpling skin you have to eat a xiao long bao carefully a you can puncture the skin easily and all of the broth will seep out i eat xiao long bao with chopstick and a chinese spoon you carefully grab the top of the dumpling with your chopstick then put the dumpling on your spoon over a bowl in case you accidentally puncture it then you bite the top of the dumpling off in order to let it cool down after that depending on it temperature you can just eat the entire thing or eat it in smaller bite i love xiao long bao and often try to beat my record of in one sitting nicolas dorazio jr masterman school philadelphia paa food i loved since my childhood is a sacred ritual every year at chinese new year this food to my family is so important that if you dont include it on your dinner list you must pay all guest dollar and that dish is dumpling drizzled in chili oil eric li masterman philadelphiathere is this certain food that i love but it not necessarily my favorite food it a very uncommon food item that im always craving it is horseradish cheese it like normal cheddar cheese but with a little radish kick in it it caught me and my dad eye once at our local supermarket and we though hmm might a well try it we bought it and when we got home we cut slice for each of u to get a taste it wa amazing simon rathmann julian r masterman schoolthe food we loathei hate mushroom straight and simple mushroom and i have never ever gotten along first of all it is a fungus and who would want to eat a fungus they grow from warm moist place that are usually rotten and most of the time they stink not only that but when you eat them they have this weird mushy texture that will make you want to barf mushroom are the villain of food they dont add flavor to your meal instead they suck the life out of it paige phillips hoggard high school wilmington nci hate shellfish like clam and muscle it just taste like seawater and sadness who like the taste of seawater liam s masterman philadelphiaone of my all time least favorite food is olive i really despise everything about them to their taste and even their look they just look like something straight out of a scifi movie and when i first tasted one i threw up i cant even get started on the red thing inside the green olive a a kid i thought it wa like the blood of the olive or something weird so i just never touched one even when someone ate an olive near me it made me cringe just by the sound of it when you eat it abdoul diallo julia r masterman philadelphiai have an extreme hatred for anything artificially orange flavored this stem from when i got a sinus infection at the age of and wa required to take amoxicillin an orangeflavored liquid medicine i had to take about tablespoon twice a day for two week and let me tell you it wa one of the most horrific and torturous experience of my life the second it touched my tongue i gagged and thought i wa actually going to throw up sivan frankel masterman school philadelphia pafish egg i hate everything about them from the texture to the taste and just thinking about eating them is enough to make me feel like vomiting i have eaten three type of fish egg before including ikura red caviar and mentaiko cod roe but the most disgusting way i have eaten fish egg before is by eating a fried shishamo a type of small fish and not knowing that they are fried while they still have egg inside of them i had never liked shishamo and taking a bite out of one and noticing hundred of small white egg spill out just made me despise those fried fish even more kaya perelman masterman philadelphiaid like to have a conversation with someone who like vinegar just so i can ask them what the appeal is zephyr spatz philadelphia mastermanevery type of chocolate white chocolate dark chocolate and milk chocolate it is all disgusting part of the reason i hate it so much is because of my sister when we were younger it wa all she ate every meal wa chocolate she loved it so much i just never wanted to eat it i tried it before and did not like it so when she ate so much chocolate it made me not want to eat it because i did not want to do anything she did after that i never tried it again and to this day i still hate chocolate and it still make me sick jonnah berger masterman philadelphia pai personally have a burning hatred of beet not like music beat but rather the vegetable with the highest sugar content in it class when i first tried beet i thought that they had gone bad because my mother had described them a sweet and really good but i only tasted a ripe sickening taste i of course then yelled ewwwwww then my mom ran over and asked what the fuss wa and i responded with something along the line of you gave me one that went bad it all squishy and gross she then picked up my fork and to a bite for herself she said that it didnt go bad and that this wa just how it tasted ian birley masterman philadelphiaone food that i now despise would have to be borscht soup it is made of potato onion carrot and most importantly beet when i wa younger i would eat borscht or want to eat borscht every single day in fact i used to refuse to eat soup that wasnt the color red what happened is the question that i now ask myself since i can not even look at the soup without gagging i think that it is the combination of soggy wet carrot and the slippery disgusting onion that i cant stand other russian or belarussians ukrainian find it so strange that i dont like a traditional russian dish but i dont care i just cant bring myself to eat it hanna sh jr masterman philadelphia paliving on the edgewhile this isnt really an obsession whenever i see a food that ha milk im compelled to eat it the only problem is that im allergic to all dairy product ever since the age of i wa careful not to eat anything with milk i would meticulously read over food label and if i wa slightly suspicious of whether or not the food product had milk i would not eat it that all changed when i wa when i wa i started to feel rebellious i wanted to live on the edge and while eating something youre allergic isnt exactly the peak of living on the edge it wa for me i wa the kid who wa scared of taking risk and here i wa the first dairy product i knowingly tried wa sour cream and onion chip i ate the whole bag and while my lip felt tingly and my throat hurt my adrenaline wa through the roof i felt ecstatic it made me feel on edge and to this day eating dairy is the closest i will be to feeling energizedever since then if i see food that contains milk i try to eat it whether it is swiping cheez it from my friend or eating pizza before a concert i dont even like the taste of dairy product cheese disgust me and chocolate make me feel sick at this point the compulsion to eat dairy override any common sense i have left the only reason i dont eat any and all dairy around me is because my friend are worried that this compulsion to eat dairy is going to kill me one day which is totally fair ami s masterman philadelphiawhen i wa younger i really liked thing that had hazelnut in them like nutella and ferrero rocher i also just liked snacking on hazelnut by themselves in general when i realized i had obtained an allergy to them i wa absolutely devastated hazelnut were my childhood and it wa like part of my innocent childish memory were stripped away from me i wa always wondering what hazelnut tasted like because over year i forgot what it tasted likeone day i just decided to eat it whats the worst that could happen i mean sure i could go to the hospital and be in excruciating pain but i want to relive my childhood i took a small spoonful of nutella spread it on a small cracker sucked air into my stomach and ate it all my memory came flooding back from this food i loved so deeply it wa like i wa in a state of euphoria until my sens hit me like a rock and suffered the consequence of the food it wa so bad i almost passed out and went to the hospital it wa a crazy experience and i dont regret any bit of it kate chin masterman philadelphia pa__________on feb le than a minute into a nationally televised game against archrival north carolina duke zion williamson injured his right knee when one of his nike sneaker exploded the incident revived question about whether shoe company should be able to pay to have player exclusively wear their gear and whether college athlete should get a cut of the profit we posed these question to student in this student opinion questionthe response were split down the middle with student on both side of the debate arguing their case persuasively we chose the comment below because they used a compelling combination of logic ethic emotion statistic and even united state law to support their claimsno college athlete should not be paidi think they really already are getting paid when we talk about college athlete getting paid were usually talking about the best of the best the one who have full scholarship to their college many time these college would cost in the ten of thousand some even in the hundred thousand but college athlete dont need to pay anything they are given access to some of the best facility in the world and sometimes even better than professional sport team with these facility these player can push themselves to their limit and become the best version of themselvesif you bring actual money into college sport it will change it forever it will change the dynamic of the whole sport many player love being in college and if they choose the right college and coach they will always be welcomed back and a second home not only are the player given the facility to develop into great athlete but if they choose a great coach the coach will mold them into great young men who are fit for anything at clemson university there is an emphasis on this dabo swinney the head coach for the football team only recruit athlete that he find fitting for the program the whole vibe at clemson is a very good vibe and many player build bond that will last forever in all the college experience is a great one and it really isnt the college experience after player are paid it just becomes another division of professional sport brian ssis hcmc vietnamcollege sport are only to represent your college and make them proud if they want money and the sport department is not giving it then let them not participate i am sure the team is not going to lose out usually in sport there are a lot of people who try out so it is easy to find a replacement for him moreover all the sport get you good fame and a good personality aadesh ssis hcmc vietnamcollege sport are a preparation for professional sport this drive many athlete to attain college level skill they use the more competitive game and intense training to get a feel for a higher level tracy argues that too many organization reap billion of dollar from the effort and talent of preprofessional athlete yes their game are televised but this doesnt just bring profit to company and college it publicizes player and give them an opportunity to be scouted by professional coach zoe lee hoggard wilmington nci feel a a student athlete your attending school not only to play sport but to also obtain good education to succeed in life when your playing a sport for a school your basically representing your school for whatever sport your playing while playing for the school the coordinator for the sport and other volunteer put in a lot of money to make sure you have the essential you need in order to play college athlete are provided with so much stuff that they dont really need to worry about money they are well taken cared of ice tresvik john t hoggard highat first i believed that college athlete should be paid because they work a hard and are a good a professional provide a source of entertainment and sell million of ticket per game they play however after reading through the comment section ive changed my mind the whole point of college is to get a good education and to use that education in the future to help them guide their way to their career however if they start getting paid they will focus on money and not their education that can result in a decrease of interest in education and grade of college player will also decrease leading to the chance of being a pro athlete decreasing a well furthermore if college athlete get paid the pay will most likely be different for each player and that will create a competitive atmosphere among the same team of athlete if college athlete get paid the pay of each player will be what defines them instead of their skill therefore i think that college athlete shouldnt be paid soyoung ssis hcmc vietnamyes college athlete deserve a cut of the profitsin my opinion i do believe college athlete should be paid or at least be able to get some type of income these athlete are bringing in over billion dollar a year including tv broadcasting ticket and even sponsor also the ncaa prohibits these athlete from getting a job or receiving any type of income and some of these athlete dont come from high rich family and they dont receive a full ride so they dont know how to pay for the rest of their tuitionin the case of zion williamson he should for sure be paid the game between duke and unc did not come cheap the average price for the game wa a little over nine thousand and cheapest price wa a little under three thousand that is what most call the zion effect tayo ojo everman high schoolpeople always say that college athlete should be thankful that they get a scholarship but scholarship arent enough degree are useless to athlete they often dont get meaningful degree they dont connection when it come to job and they arent allowed to get internship because of ncaa rule student also cant work during the season most of them dont care about their subject i dont blame them because they have to balance sport and class and their schedule sound like a nightmare they arent guided on life outside of sport if these student get a job outside of sport theyre going to have a hard time competing in the job marketthe athlete should get paid so they have something to fall back on if they dont become professional athlete which ha le than a chance of happening even if college wa useful only of athlete get enough grant and scholarship to cover the full cost of college ncaa doesnt even compensate for player injury there are injury for every and there were injury from to player can lose scholarship if they get injured the word studentathlete wa created in the s to avoid worker compensation ami s masterman philadelphiaat first glance the prospect of paying college student a salary on top of their scholarship seems ridiculous however when you look closer and on a case to case basis it becomes more ridiculous to ignore the evidence that point to the contrary for college athlete at this level of competition they have had to train and devote their entire life to becoming the physical specimen needed to play division one athletics with this kind of commitment to excellence often come a disregard for other thing if these student are spending more of their time becoming athlete than studying and learning they will not be well suited for the world after sport therefore by using these student talent to make money for the ncaa and not compensating these player they are not only stealing from them but compromising their future forever ezra lombarditickets for the duke v carolina game were being sold for upwards of dollar and i can personally guarantee that athlete like zion williamson did not see a penny of this money ironically without athlete these event would not be possible although college athlete receive prestigious scholarship they are minuscule compared to the amount college brand and the ncaa make from one game alone i believe college athlete should receive a percentage of the money that is made from event they participate in game they play and use of their imageeven though college athlete are paid in fame training and scholarship there are also definite risk and drawback injury is a constant risk that could potentially end the career of any athlete at any time zion williamson is a perfect example of this if his injury had been worse his career could have been ended and any athletic scholarship would be revoked erin johnston hoggard high school wilmington ncthey should be paid but howpeople have brought up the point that scholarship arent enough and that since the ncaa and the college make so much money off of some of these game then player should be paid for them but if player were played for these game then how much would they be paid would all athlete be paid the same amount or would they be paid off based on the amount of ticket they sell for their gamesi think all athlete being paid a fixed amount for each game would be a good way for them to be able to keep playing their sport a well being able to have money to survive in college but i feel like if a system like this wa put in place then there would be outrage people would say that athlete should be paid based on the amount of ticket their game sell but is that really fair obviously college football and basketball will sell the most ticket by far and then player on those team would get paid more but some sport like track and baseball would not sell anywhere near a much ticket and then there player would be paid lessi think that if this system is put in place there would be outrage and it would lead to more debate on the ncaa system because then bench player who rarely see playing time would be paid more than star in other sport i think that a way to resolve the pay issue would be to let student athlete get other job paul n nhrhs njstudentathletes are being exploited by school the ncaa and shoe companiesi believe studentathletes should be paid something in addition to scholarship and grant even if it is minimal big corporation take all the money from the athlete for example nike get to showcase their jersey and shoe every single national televised game meanwhile zion is not getting anything every williamson jersey that is sold isnt giving money to zion it is all going toward nike if college athlete were allowed to sign with a shoe brand zion would definitely have it own brand overall the ncaa and other company are taking advantage of studentathletes and these athlete should be getting paid something michael h nhrhscompanies like nike and the ncaa turn collage player into walking ad and yet these player get nothing it like if you didnt pay to put ad on billboard but those billboard were self dependent living thing who needed to somehow pay for food and a decent living space while also taking class and having billboard practice every day after those class and one single scrape on that billboard

advertisementsupported byon college basketballby marc tracyif the opinion published friday night in a landmark college sport antitrust case were a novel then it villain would be the ncaain a novellalength page opinion united state district court judge claudia wilken criticizes berates even mock the ncaa for it refusal to allow college to compensate player for their valuable labor beyond a scholarship and related cost of attendance all in the name of something they call amateurismdefendants nowhere define the nature of the amateurism they claim consumer insist upon said wilken referring to the ncaa and several of it richest most prominent conferenceseven if they had wilken continued she pointed to numerous exception when player could effectively be paid player are paid beyond scholarship all the time in untold million of dollar invested in training facility in gift for participating in bowl game in fund available to purchase lossofvalue insurancethe rule that permit limit or forbid studentathlete compensation and benefit do not follow any coherent definition of amateurism she saidthe decision stem from a longrunning case in which a group of college athlete sued the ncaa and athletic conference that participate in the top level of basketball and football they contended that the ruling body of college sport had colluded to enact a system that unfairly limit the compensation they receive when they are attending and competing for their university the ncaa and the conference argue that those limit are essential for promoting amateurism and enhancing the value of college sport and undergraduate educationin her decision wilken seems to say that those rule did restrain trade producing significant anticompetitive effectsthe clerk wilken added on the final page with the majestic understatement of a good literary denouement shall enter judgment for the plaintiff classso why doesnt it feel a if the group of athlete who pursued the litigation to end the ncaas rule won the case why did they and their star sport labor lawyer jeffrey kessler not get the outcome they most fervently soughtdespite finding that the ncaa wa violating federal law wilken turned away the plaintiff main proposed remedy which wa also the logical one to lift the supposedly lawbreaking cap on compensation that mean the continuation of a status quo where so many player feel they are working basically for free hows thatwhen you apply a uniquely muddled set of law to a unique industry this is the kind of ruling you get said gabe feldman who directs tulanes sport law program and teach antitrust law the unique muddle to which he wa referringthe upshot of friday ruling pending a likely appeal is that the ncaa may continue to cap payment to athlete after all with the limited exception of expense that are educational in nature think computer or cost related to internship or postgraduate scholarshipsdont think stipend of or or because the player receiving it is good enough that he or she is worth even more than that to the college in increased ticket sale and medium exposure and television right paymentsno wonder several of the defendant responded this weekend with the kind of equanimity one doe not expect from party that technically lost a casethe decision reaffirms the fundamental principle of the collegiate athletic model and of amateurism pacific commissioner larry scott said in a statement studentathletes are first and foremost student who attend college to receive an education and to prepare themselves for success in life while also pursuing athletic excellencescotts statement is more aspirational than descriptive there are basketball player who conclude their college career before finishing even a year of collegesimilarly the reaction from playersrights advocate wa more muted than you might expect postvictorythis is progress but it just one step ramogi huma of the college athlete player association said in a text message this ruling still treat athlete a secondclass citizen no other student or citizen is subject to such harmful economic pricefixing especially one imposed by a repeat antitrust violator that doe not have an antitrust exemptionhow can a judge rule that a law is being broken but allow the lawbreaking to continueaccording to feldman the answer includes a muchdisputed antitrust principle known a the rule of reason in some case including this one the rule call for anticompetitive activity to be overturned only if there is a different system that could provide the positive benefit of the anticompetitive system without suppressing other competition a muchwilken determined that amateurism wa crucial to college sport commercial appeal and allowed it to compete with professional sport even if doing so required it to apparently violate antitrust lawthe court doe credit the importance to consumer demand of maintaining a distinction between college sport and professional sport she saidcourts have given sport league a wide berth when it come to antitrust feldman said the argument is that sport are uniqueafter all sport can not really exist unless say team are allowed to agree to the same rule in men basketball even though that might technically constitute collusion in any other realm of commercewilken wa also following precedent most of all she wa following a precedent set by the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit her circuitin an earlier case known a obannon the appellate court agreed with part of a wilken finding at the district court level that the ncaa ban on compensating athlete for the commercial use of their name image and likeness in thing like video game wa an antitrust violation but the appellate judge overturned her proposal that athlete be able to receive up to annually in exchange the ninth circuit reasoning wa that such payment were not tethered to educationyou can draw a direct line between that phrase from and wilkens ruling in this case that is how she solomonically decided that the ncaa may restrict payment a long a they are noneducationalfuture plaintiff if they challenge ncaa rule will look for a jurisdiction outside of the ninth circuit feldman said the ninth circuit after all ha now made it very clear it will defer to the ncaaanother venue could rule in a more plaintifffriendly direction kessler the prominent sport lawyer may now be able to push forward with a nearly identical case in federal district court in new jerseyeither way the future of college athletics is now out of the hand of wilken who for nearly a decade ha loomed over ither decision last friday may be a result of her understanding her power and it limit numerous observer expected a more plaintifffriendly ruling based on the question she asked during

action in five month and now at the eightmonth mark is winning significant tournamentswhat bob is doing is incredible su said in a telephone interview on monday he really is demonstrating what determination and his hard work can accomplish with a new implantincredible is quite a word choice from a surgeon who ha performed more than such procedure a few others were on professional athlete trying to save their career including the former major league pitcher colby lewisbut no professional tennis player ha had this procedure and returned to the fore although andy murray who underwent the same type of operation in january in london after plenty of chatting and texting with bryan may try to do the samethe thing that make bob bryan great you dont know if you are going to lose that with

playing like the yearold bobhes exploding to poaches like the old day when he would just steal point from incredible crosscourt return by flashing across the net with the speed of light and picking

are not feeling great and probably a little concerned bryan said but i think he probably feeling really good right nowmurray ha posted video of himself on social medium lightly hitting tennis ball but returning in single with fullcourt coverage required is a more daunting prospecti think a threeoutoffiveset single match is almost close to time more physical than double bryan said it going to really challenge andy the movement but i can jump i can lunge and i am not sore after matchesas murray debated whether to have surgery bryan put him in touch with su who said murray wa an ideal candidate for

millimeter bryan said ive talked to people who had different doctor and have done the same procedure and they feel like crapsu said he believed bryan recovery had been accelerated in part by the use

dive but he done it several time and no worse for the wearwill such acrobatics and the other rigor of professional tennis put bryan at greater risk of requiring followup surgery down the roadthats a really good question we dont have the answer to su said we dont have enough data in term of how it would hold up to activity such a this this ha been done now for almost two decade so there are some

advertisementsupported byby kevin drapermontreal the world antidoping association compliance review committee will meet in montreal the organization home city on monday and tuesday to discus a problem that will not go away russia antidoping laboratory and what to do about the country missing a key endofyear deadlineno matter what the committee recommends and the possibility range from competition ban to mere slap on the wrist to nothing the longrunning story of russia antidoping laboratory is bound to continuehanging in the balance is the credibility of the world foremost antidoping watchdog which ha endured withering criticism from athlete in recent month who say the organization ha allowed a rogue nation to run roughshod over it attempt at enforcementin an open letter last week to jonathan taylor the chairman of the compliance review committee the swedish biathlete sebastian samuelsson wrote given that this doping crisis involving russia is the biggest in history and the fact that many athlete have so shamefully been cheated out of podium position not to mention financial reward by the statesponsored doping system this issue requires proper leadership and good honest communication two thing that have been very neglected by the current wada leadershipwada leader have said they remain committed to clean sport and holding russia to accountroughly four year after russia corruption of the drugtesting process first came to light wadas executive committee voted to in september to allow russia to resume testing it own athlete for performanceenhancing drug even though it had not fulfilled every requirement of a compliance agreementrussias drugtesting agency had been banned since after a vast statesponsored doping scheme wa uncovered while russian athlete were cleared to compete in the winter olympics in pyeongchang south korea they competed under the banner of olympic athlete from russia and russia remains a controversial member of the international sport world in russian athlete had to receive special permission from the international federation governing their sport to compete at the rio gamesindividual federation have handled the situation differently some like the international association of athletics federation which oversees track and field have barred all russian athlete from competing since others like soccer governing body fifa have allowed them to competethe reinstatement of the russian antidoping agency laboratory came with a number of condition attached all of which russia agreed to the most significant condition compelled russia to hand over data from it corrupted antidoping laboratory by the end of the year numerous wada team sent to russia were rebuffed and russia missed the deadlinelast week a threeperson wada team in moscow wa finally allowed into the laboratory to begin collecting data the computer data sought by wada investigator had been sealed off by russian law enforcement leading to the bizarre circumstance of the russian antidoping agency urging the russian government to cooperate with wada on an investigation of the russian antidoping agency own laboratoriesit wa unclear whether the work would be completed before the compliance review committee began meeting at wadas headquarters on monday or if russian law enforcement would impose any more hurdle but even if the work is completed it is highly unlikely that wada official will quickly be able to certify that the data is complete and authentic and some skeptic will not trust the data no matter what because russia missed the deadlineon monday i will be asking have we got the data and if the answer is no it will be a short discussion said taylor a lawyer based in london his implication wa that if the data wa incomplete the committee would have no choice but to recommend russia be declared noncompliantif that happens the future participation of russian athlete in international competition will once again be in doubt a situation that major sport organization like the international olympic committee are desperate to avoida number of sporting figure have called for russia to be declared noncompliant for missing the deadline most prominently wadas own athlete committee ha said it expects russia to be declared noncompliant and that anything le will be considered a failure by wada to act on behalf of clean athletestravis tygart the head of the united state antidoping agency and a vocal critic of how wada ha handled russia sounded a cautious note on fridayof course if accurate it is a good thing that the signal emerging from wada are that it group ha been allowed into the moscow laboratory he said in a statement but in the meantime he belief russia should be declared noncomplianteven if wada obtains all the data managing the process remains complicated the question will be how do we move forward what do we do about the fact that they are late what do we do about the fact that we dont know yet that the data are authentic taylor saidthe committee will make a recommendation and send it to wadas executive committee which is expected to meet later in januarythe executive committee which generally follows the recommendation of the compliance review committee can choose to do nothing and allow russia reinstatement to remain if it decides to once again seek the suspension of russia antidoping laboratory it will send a letter asserting noncompliance laying out a set of recommended consequence russia would then have day to decide whether to agree or to challenge the noncompliance in front of the court of arbitration for sportif wada decline to seek noncompliance the next deadline is june by then russia must submit any stored athlete sample that based on the data wada wish to examinethe data wada seek consists of about suspicious doping sample assuming wada find that a number of them contain evidence of doping it will be up to the dozen of individual sport federation to bring case and charge the athletesin other word whether russia is declared noncompliant or not the continuing fallout from the country doping scheme is likely to stretch deep into especially with the world track and field championship set for september in doha qataradvertisement

playing maybe youll watch a game together or exchange nervous text in a game final moment maybe youll end up jumping around your house in joy at some point in the next couple week with your kid or siblingslisten to the argument podcast every thursday morning with ross douthat michelle goldberg and david leonhardtcollege sport bring people a lot of joy a one of my college roommate texted me last week a a way of objecting to my recent criticism of sport im happier when our basketball team is good he got a point sport create shared experience in a way that few other activity in this country dothis communal function mean that college have a good reason to treat some athlete differently from most other applicant yes the college should make sure theyre admitting only athlete with the academic preparation to graduate but i understand why the basketball player representing the university of minnesota today dont necessarily need the same academic qualification a the student oboist or journalist at minnesota those athlete bring something to the campus that few other student canwhy in the worldbut it important to remember something else most college sport dont look anything like basketball they dont bring a lot of people together their crowd are small they dont have many spillover benefit for the other part of a university they exist largely for the benefit of the athlete themselves which make them not so different from many other extracurricular activitiesand these other sport are often disproportionately played by white relatively welloff student they dont add much diversity to a campus only percent of male college lacrosse player are black a justin wolfers of the university of michigan ha noted only percent of fencer are in golf the share is percent in water polo it percentyet college treat athlete in these sport a an entirely different specie of applicant the athlete dont need to have nearly a strong application a other studentsbecause so many of these sport exist the share of athlete at some college is shockingly high roughly percent or onefifth of the entering class at the ivy league university and the leading small liberal art college are recruited athlete jonathan cole a top former official at columbia university and before that a college athlete ha written why in the world are the school using up percent of their slot on recruited athlete the answer cole explains is that sport have become a kind of arm racein a recent newsletter i mentioned that about one in five student at williams college in western massachusetts wa an athlete according to an outside estimate that turn out to be wrong and too conservative williams is on the high end of the distribution with about percent of student being recruited athlete according to the collegecole is right that this situation doesnt make any sense i am fully aware that fencer golfer water polo player and other athlete work extremely hard but so do many other student who participate in other extracurricular activity and have superior academic record those other student are often rejected to make room for the athlete the problem is the special treatment that so many athlete are receivingin a better system most college would substantially shrink the number of athlete they recruit each would keep a modest number of sport split equally between men and woman for which they would recruit athlete and still give huge admission bonus these wouldnt be the only team that college fielded but the other sport would follow a classic scholarathlete model the member of the team would no longer receive extraspecial treatment in the admission process they would be student who happened to be athlete and they would compete with other team filled with similar athletesis any college brave enough to move in this directionrelatedon this week episode of the argument podcast we talk about what a better college admission system could look like we also debate whether

advertisementsupported byphys edregular exercise change the look and working of the human heart and researcher are discovering that different sport affect the heart differently by gretchen reynoldsdo worldclass swimmer heart function differently than the heart of elite runnersa new study find that the answer may be yes and the difference although slight could be telling and consequential even for those of u who swim or run at a much le lofty level cardiologist and exercise scientist already know that regular exercise change the look and working of the human heart the left ventricle in particular alters with exercise this chamber of the heart receives oxygenrich blood from the lung and pump it out to the rest of the body using a rather strenuous twisting and unspooling motion a if the ventricle were a sponge being wrung out before springing back into shapeexercise especially aerobic exercise requires that considerable oxygen be delivered to working muscle placing high demand on the left ventricle in response this part of the heart in athlete typically becomes larger and stronger than in sedentary people and function more efficiently filling with blood a little earlier and more fully and untwisting with each heartbeat a bit more rapidly allowing the heart to pump more blood more quicklywhile almost any exercise can prompt remodeling of the left ventricle over time different type of exercise often produce subtly different effect a study found for instance that competitive rower whose sport combine endurance and power had greater muscle mass in their left ventricle than runner making their heart strong but potentially le nimble during the twisting that pump blood to muscle these past study compared the cardiac effect of landbased activity though with an emphasis on running few have examined swimming even though it is not only a popular exercise but unique swimmer unlike runner lie prone in buoyant water and hold their breath all of which could affect cardiac demand and how the heart responds and remake itselfso for the new study which wa published in november in frontier in physiology researcher at the university of guelph in canada and

and blood pressure and finally examined the athlete heart with echocardiogram which show both the structure and functioning of the organit turned out to no one surprise that the athlete whether runner or swimmer enjoyed enviable heart health their heart rate hovered around beat per minute with the runner rate slightly lower than the swimmer but all of the athlete heart rate were much lower than is typical for sedentary people signifying that their heart were robustthe athlete also had relatively large efficient left ventricle their echocardiogram showedbut there were interesting if small difference between the swimmer and runner the researcher found while all of the athlete left ventricle filled with blood earlier than average and untwisted more quickly during each heartbeat those desirable change were amplified in the runner their ventricle filled even earlier and untwisted more emphatically than the swimmer heart didin theory those difference should allow blood to move from and back to the runner heart more rapidly than would happen inside the swimmersbut these difference do not necessarily show that the runner heart worked better than the swimmer say jamie burr a professor at the university of guelph and director of it human performance lab who conducted the new study with the lead author katharine currie and otherssince swimmer exercise in a horizontal position he say their heart do not have to fight gravity to get blood back to the heart unlike in upright runner posture doe some of the work for swimmer and so their heart reshape themselves only a much a needed for the demand of their sportthe finding underscore how exquisitely sensitive our body are to different type of exercise dr burr saysthey also might provide a reason for swimmer sometimes to consider logging mile on the road he say to intensify the remodeling of their heartsof course the athlete here were tested while resting not competing he say and it is not clear whether any variation in their ventricle would be meaningful during racesthe study also wa crosssectional meaning it looked at the athlete only once they might have been born with unusual cardiac structure that somehow allowed them to excel at their sport instead of the sport changing their heartsdr burr however doubt that exercise almost certainly remake our heart he say and he hope future experiment can tell u more about how each activity affect u and which might be best for different peoplebut even now he say an important message is that all of the athlete showed better function than a normal person off the street which support the message that exercise is good for heartsadvertisement

curious positiona year earlier a universitycommissioned report had found that the african and afroamerican study department had offered nearly fraudulent class over almost two decade these class had been disproportionately populated by athlete in the highprofile sport of football and basketball who in some case were steered by athletic department tutor who knew the course required little workthe result wa one of the worst academic scandal in college sport history and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and it proud athletic program the university accreditation body placed north carolina on probation the ncaa conducted an investigationbut critic saw few systemic changesthered been none of these public forum no sign of lesson learned smith said recentlya history professor whose area of study is prerevolutionary france smith had been agitating about the scandal for several year he had even written a book about the affair cheated with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classesi thought i can not rely on this institution to do the right thing smith said and i think it would be an abdication of responsibility for u to pas up the opportunity to provide student at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal how it happened what it say about college sport what it tell u about the plight of athletesand that is why earlier this week a the men college basketball world turned it attention to the final four an event the tar heel qualified for in and winning the title in the latter year well over undergraduate heard smith lecture on the scandal a part of his increasingly popular course history bigtime college sport and the right of athlete to the presentstudents in the class read cheated and pay for play a

although he wondered whether his superior took it that way when two senior administrator seemed to be pressuring the thendepartment chair to cancel the course a few year ago the official said their question about the course had nothing to do with it content the provost overturned a grievance committee finding that the official interference had been unduemore righteous than selfrighteous smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sport system at north carolina and elsewherehis class he insisted doe not have an agenda but it certainly ha a point of view and that includes the notion that effort like the class itself are futileby examining all these earlier episode of growth followed by handwringing and effort at reform which inevitably fail what they see is there are systemic feature in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable smith saidsmith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality one in which the scandal resulted from the working of the college sport industry including how it prevents athlete from getting a piece of the profit they generatewhile smith ha clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sport industry rather than to college athlete this ambiguity lead to misconception according to lydia thompson a senior on the rowing team who is taking the classstudents hear critique of the way in which athlete have been abused by the educational system thompson wrote in an email and automatically extrapolate those critique and apply them to athlete who merely have to abide by the rule of that systemsmith ha taught at chapel hill since having arrived during the era of good feeling associated with the legendary late basketball coach dean smith no relation i drank the koolaid he saidwithin three year of his arrival though according to a university report the academic fraud had begun it did not begin to come to light until right around when jay smith involvement with it commencedthat summer a football player named mike mcadoo sued the university and the ncaa over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct a studentrun honor court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnote but the paper which wa disclosed in court filing included plagiarism and that discovery led to a stream of revelation that eventually exposed the fakeclasses scandalsmith wa serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honor court when a reporter asked to discus mcadoo smith looked up the paper and wa flabbergasted he said not only by it blatant evidence of plagiarism but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course julius nyangoro wa not a language instructor nyangoro the african and afroamerican study chair wa later found to be complicit in the scandalall of this smelled really really fishy to me smith saidsmith and a few other faculty member convened an ad hoc group for academic reform a neophyte when it came to college athletics smith wa tutored by richard southall a professor who directed the university college sport research institutesouthall whose institute is now housed at the university of south carolina said he gave the group a primer on college sport with the thesis that scandal are the regular inevitable consequence of the conflict between the ncaas

sportslast sunday when tiger wood won the master after his long drought it wa more than just one of the most incredible comeback in history it showed america eagerness to embrace a man who persevered through year of setback especially selfinflicted one regardless of whatever selective amnesia that requiresamerica doe love a comeback achievement in sport somehow make u more willing to compartmentalize to forgive transgression to make a complicated man more deserving of public redemption and wood at age needed a lot of redeeming his fall from grace started in when his wife caught him cheating with multiple woman and continued through when he pleaded guilty to reckless driving a he plotted his comeback wood ha emerged a a unique figure both president barack obama and president trump applauded him mr trump will even award him a medal this ability to charm so many different american ha almost certainly aided his return to grace while also alienating a large swath of society that see him a inauthentic why arent there more redemption story like this among woman it not just because woman arent given second chance it because they are rarely able to reach those height in the first placemany highachieving people regardless of gender have an icarus complex the extreme quality and the obsessive pursuit of success that drive their ascent can lead to their downfall the discipline and pressure can lead to addiction the opposite of control obviously we saw that in wood following his descent grew excruciating but it fit the narrativewoods understood this entering rehab in after accusation of infidelity sex addiction and substance abuse he said i felt that i had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptation around me i felt i wa entitledin men excessive quality can be forgiven even admired when it work out at least his trajectory is a reminder of who pay forever for their mistake and whose transgression can be set asidepart of the problem is that so few woman even reach the athletic height of wood let alone stay there yes we have the extraordinary serena williams but can you name another female athlete on the financial and cultural level a tiger wood lebron james tom brady and their peer of the few iconic woman sponsor and fan to a certain degree want them to be perfect or at least quiet woman moral behavior deeply influence our perception of their professional achievementsconsider how swiftly the olympic runner and ninetime ncaa champion suzy favor hamilton wa vilified after she wa caught working a an escort while coping with mental illness nike immediately severed tie a did many other group associated with her the athletic achievement on her wikipedia page became subsumed by story of prostitution it wa a if i must have murdered someone favor hamilton said recently never a degree of well perhaps something must be very much wrong for hamilton the attraction to vice fulfilled the same thing many elite athlete get from the rush of victory in sport it wa the buzz i felt a an athlete she said i have a history of taking thing to extremesmost champion dooksana baiul won an olympic gold medal in figure skating for her native ukraine in and moved to connecticut with million of dollar after having slept alone in an ice rink a an impoverished orphan a few year later she had been charged with a duo and gone through rehab for alcohol abuse she appears serious about trying to turn her life around and returning to respectability the time reported in noting the pound shed lost since the previous winter when she wa drinking and overweight and barely able to land any jumpspoiler she didnt return to competitive skatingtwo great female athlete did have major comeback but the setback were totally different monica seles wa victimized by a maniacal fan who stabbed her on the court and serena williams is in the midst of comeback after having a baby like wood each of these woman had physical setback but neither of them made mistake except williams ha surpassed her male peer and demonstrated the flip side of the extreme confident and righteous quality necessary to achieve success she dared to get angry and show it when she opposed what she considered an unfair call at the united state open last september the public immediately chastised her there wa silence and then a lot of instagram post about motherhood and her daughter no woman have the leeway to behave like wood and get away with it a black woman certainly doe not just imagine the reaction if serena williams wa caught cheating on her husband alexis ohanian with numerous menthere are also practical ingredient of a comeback it requires support both popular and financial nike never abandoned wood analyst said his win generated worth more than million in exposure for the companywomen literally can not afford to make the messy mistake we see in the long arc of a lot of a storied male athlete career and they rarely get the payoffsim no tiger wood hamilton told me there is so much money at stake with someone like him so a company like nike will do anything to protect him and his image she still had a relationship with nike when report of her escort work prompted the company to drop her now she said im on an island trying to protect myselfsociety rarely allows woman to nurture those bold quality that drive standout success instead to get ahead woman either learn to stifle those instinct or get punished for them this muffle the trait that might lead to failure and inevitably also the quality that lead to successto be sure some men are being held accountable for their bad behavior these day and wood faced widespread public scorn after his philandering and reckless driving but that evaporated last weekend when he wa widely celebrated after having been encouraged to pursue his comeback shouldnt everyone be able to recover from a fall from grace or at the very least shouldnt we allow both men and woman to get high enough

advertisementsupported byphys edresearch ha raised concern that activity like cycling and swimming may put too little pressure on bonesby gretchen reynoldscould competitive cyclist be putting their bone health at riska disquieting new study of bone density in elite cyclist and runner suggests that the answer might be yes the study found that the cyclist both male and female had thinner bone than the runner even though all of the athlete were young healthy and enviably fit and many of the cyclist lifted weightsthe result underscore the divergent effect of various sport on our skeleton and also stir a little unease about the longterm impact of pursuing lowimpact exercise at the expense of more highimpact activitiesby and large the available scientific evidence show that physical activity is desirable and even necessary for bone health child who run hop and play develop thicker stronger bone than those who remain sedentary a do teenager and young adult who participate in sport involving sprinting and leapingmost scientist agree that these kind of activity build skeletal strength by generating sudden sharp force that minutely bow or deform the affected bone such activity jumpstart process within the body that increase the number of bone cell and help to prepare those part of the skeleton to withstand similar force in the futureeven middleaged and older people who once were thought to face inevitable thinning of their bone with age can maintain strong skeleton if they are sufficiently active recent study showbut which type of exercise bend bone in a desirable way and which are too gentle remains uncertain some past study suggest that running generates enough force to remodel bone while other experiment with runner conclude the opposite ditto with weight training and multiple study have raised concern about negligible or even adverse effect from non weightbearing exercise such a cycling and swimming which put little pressure on bonesin hope of gaining more clarity about sport and bone researcher at the norwegian school of sport science and the norwegian olympic training center in oslo decided to look closely at the skeleton of worldclass competitive cyclist and runnersthey focused on elite fulltime athlete in large part because the athlete heavy training could be expected to amplify any impact from and difference between the two sportsthey wound up recruiting highlevel runner and road cyclist men and woman most of them in their s and all of them lean fit and with several year of intense competition behind themthe athlete reported to a lab where scientist measured their body composition with particular focus on the density of their bone both over all and in their lower spine and the top of their femur portion of the skeleton that can indicate general bone healththe researcher also asked the athlete about their training health and calcium intake and whether they spent much time in the gym the latter question wa of particular interest to the researcher since weight training often is recommended to athlete in sport like cycling to bulk up their bone a well a their musclesthe scientist then compared data some of the difference between athlete were substantial if expected the cyclist trained far more than the runner for instance averaging about hour a year in the saddle versus about annual hour on the road or treadmill for the runnersthe cyclist also did more weight training with most of them heading to the gym during their offseason for intense lifting none of the runner did thatthe athlete in both sport consumed enough calcium to meet their expected daily requirementsbut they had noticeably different bonesthe cyclist a a group all had thinner bone than the runner and more than half of them met medical criterion for low bone mineral density in some portion of their skeleton one of the rider a man displayed clinical osteoporosis in his spinethese result are potentially worrisome say oddbjorn klomsten andersen a graduate student at the norwegian school of sport science and a former nationalteam cyclist himself who led the study which wa published in bmj open sport exercise medicinethere are limited study following young cyclist through their career he say but study in master cyclist demonstrate that a larger proportion of them have low bone mineral density or osteoporosis than people who do not cyclethis study can not tell u though why cyclist bone might be thin he add they could have been eating too little or sweating too much for ideal bone health both low calorie intake and high rate of calcium loss through sweating have been tied to bone loss in other studiesmore surprising the cyclist heavy weight training seems not to have built much bonebut a mr andersen point out this wa a onetime snapshot of the athlete health it possible he say that weight training prevented even greater bone thinningit is also encouraging he say that the runner harbored relatively healthy bone since some past study have hinted that running might not stimulate bone buildingover all the study finding suggest that serious cyclist might want to consider at least sometimes branching out mr andersen saysi would generally recommend combining cycling with weightbearing exercise to promote good bone health he saysadvertisement

james is serena williams the greatest athlete of all time or is it muhammad alijesse owen won four gold medal in the munich olympics in broke or equaled nine olympic record also set three world record and singlehandedly shattered adolf hitler myth of aryan superiority yet his record mark of second in the meter would today be foot behind usain bolt record of would it be more fair to incorporate broader cultural accomplishment or should the greatest of all time focus solely on the numbersstudent challenge make your case for the goatfirst ask your student to decide which aspect of the goat debate they would like to tackle greatest play season game coach athlete et ceteranext they should define their criterion for greatness doe greatest mean the player you want to be up at bat in the seventh game of the world series two out in the bottom of the ninth is it instead the number of an athlete victory his or her longevity the relative strength of the competition the athlete impact within a well a beyond the sportadvance evidencebased argument and tackle counterargument use a model text or two to help student move from mere assertion or opinion to rigorous evidencebased argument here are a few excerpt to highlight how author both support claim with evidence and anticipate counterargumentsin is russell westbrooks season the best ever some apple and orange to pick from jeré longman support his claim with evidence using sport statisticswestbrooks season while awesome is not the greatest in nba history that belongs to none other than wilt chamberlain in with the philadelphia warrior chamberlain averaged point and rebound that season and this may be the greatest stat in all of sport minute played per game regulation game last minute but the warrior played seven game that extended for at least one period of overtime during that game regular season chamberlain played of philadelphia possible minuteson march chamberlain famously scored point against the knicks but that wa only the culmination of a fourgame stretch in which he scored and point in the three previous game according to basketballreferencecom all told he scored at least point time that season including a stunning performance on dec against the lakers in which chamberlain delivered point and reboundsin it time to appreciate serena williams greatness christopher clarey anticipates counterargumentsin light of that and williams enduring excellence there is momentum building behind the concept of deeming her the greatest player ever it is a subjective process one in which it is always tempting to give too much weight to the great champion in front of you the one whose victory under pressure is freshest in your mindwhat is beyond dispute is that williams ha not been nearly a consistent in regular tour event during her career a player like navratilova chris evert and grafnavratilova won single title a well a double title in an era when double wa much more prestigious than now evert won single title graf who did not play a long a williams ha played won williams for the moment ha which put her in a tie for sixth on the career list with billie jean king but if greatest mean the player who would have beaten all the rest at their peak it is hard not to feel a strong pull in williams direction her power serving and her serving under pressure are weapon that no other great player ha possessed to the same degree modern equipment is certainly a factor but she is also complete off the ground and guided by her coach patrick mouratoglou improving her volley overhead and tactical variationstogether the class might analyze how these author develop their case for goat for example by defining their term for greatness providing evidence to support claim and anticipating and then considering potential counterclaimshere are additional resource from the time and elsewhere that can provide alternative mentor textsthe fine line what make simone bile the world

right answer to the goat question to some jesse owen will always be the goat for his cultural impact for others bill russell nba championship will trump all other measure but that is the beauty of the

sport should player have the right to kneel during the national anthem should college athlete be paidthese are just a few of the countless debate that come and go in the world of sport any one of them

research question assert a strong claim and study mentor text a a way to improve their debate writing and speaking skill and these three topic are just the tip of the iceberg at the end of the section we suggest another current issue in sport for student to explore and were confident your student would have plenty more topic to add to our listcase study sport and concussionssports are often associated with heroism endurance toughness and valor it ha long been assumed that an athlete will have to make physical sacrifice to achieve greatness but the sacrifice is now being questioned because of change in our understanding of the impact sport can have on our body and mindsthe brain trauma sustained in football and other contact sport is now linked to longterm cognitive impairment including memory loss confusion depression and dementia although medium coverage of concussion ha focused on tackle football these health issue are evident in many other sport like hockey soccer basketball nascar skiing snowboarding and bmx freestyle among othersthe debate is not merely academic it is causing significant change to our understanding of athlete and athletics and is threatening the future viability of some of the world most popular sportsdevelop winning questionsresearch generally begin with asking good question even a topic a seemingly straight forward a sportsrelated concussion ha many layer of complexity so student should begin their research by asking themselves what about this topic interest me most what do i want to learn more aboutfor example if they want to start with the science they might generate question like what is the impact of a single concussion what is the longterm impact of brain trauma what is the degenerative brain disease cte and what is the impact of concussion on youthsor they may instead decide to investigate the role equipment play look into possible reform or consider ethical implication if they decide to go in any of these direction they might come up with question like how do concussion affect athlete short and longterm physical and mental health how doe this affect the people around them what is the role of equipment in brain trauma can equipment reduce concussion or doe it give player a false sense of security therefore making the problem worse should parent let their child play football or are we obsessing about the danger should we a fan still watch footballno matter what question or question student start with research inevitably lead to asking more questionssome other relevant resource nfl brain all but

memory but perhaps no act of political protest today is more polarizing than the stance by colin kaepernick to kneel during the national anthem at nfl gamesif student want to argue a position related to recent national anthem protest they should start by asking a question for example should athlete have the right to kneel during the national anthem or are athlete who protest being patriotic or unpatriotic a student do research they will gather evidence that will support a position once they find enough compelling evidence they are ready to assert a claim or thesis or resolutionassert a

same can be said for defining term like performanceenhancing drug in the debate about steroid or patriotic in the discussion about national anthem protest when it come to deciding what should or

from the now defunct north american soccer leaguethe nasl of the s had to my mind a fairer optionit required an outfield player to run with the ball from yard out giving him five second to score and allowing the goalkeeper to advance toward the playerthat at least contained more skill than the single shot of a nervous fatigued individualno matter what rule they focus on student should be clear to state the problem with the status quo and support their claim with detail then they should propose a solution and explain why it would help to eliminate or at least improve the problem with the

crouseevery time ryan crouser fly for work he brace for question dont worry he tell security the fiveinch sphere filled with pound of steel pellet checked into his reinforced luggage is just his shotthat rarely help it seems that like most people employee of the transportation security administration do not know much about the shotput the track and field event crouser ha come to dominateyou cant really blame them but our bag get pulled every flight said crouser who flew to new york for the second time in a month last week to compete in the usa track field indoor championship there a usual he competed with his friend and rival joe kovacs the two are the reigning olympic gold and silver medalist in the shotput for the unfamiliar thats the event in which gigantic athlete sheathed in spandex heave palmsize sphere the weight of bowling ball full of steel lead or tungsten a far a they can crouser got the best of kovacs again at the indoor championship on saturday in staten island putting his shot foot inch to kovacss foot inch crouser and kovacss domination of shotput is one of the lesser known story in track and field a sport that doe not have to worry about overexposure shotput at the elite level is an often thankless job with most of the suffering and little of the glory common to other professional sport the athlete work is grueling and doesnt make them rich it barely make them famous even in their hometown in oregon and pennsylvaniait ha though made each of them a friend a they travel the world someone with whom they can bond over their absurd intake of food their rare moment in the spotlight and the simplicity of their sport you dont have to worry about the implement or the element or even a team said crouser who is foot and about pound it almost get addicting to measure your progress so accurately all that matter is pure powercrouser and kovacs are embarking on an month globetrotting journey that will most likely take them to the world championship in doha qatar and the olympics in tokyo where they hope to successfully defend their title or in kovacss case swap place with crouser on the podium being the best in the united state these day generally mean being the best in the world whether their fellow american notice or not they took first and second place at the millrose game this month in manhattan before repeating at the national indoor championship last weekend in staten islandso how doe one become good at shotput start by learning math there not much more to throwing a shot than launching a cannon ball kovacs who ha a finance degree from penn state explained in a recent interview when the ball come out the angle and velocity is just a physic problem if you can put the velocity behind it youre going to have a good throwshotputters might be the only athlete in the world who refer to themselves seriously a human cannonsthe athlete keep their eye wide open a they push the ball forward and are able to estimate their throw distance within a foot the common spin technique us rotational momentum for power rather than the more traditional and linear glide approach each release produce a bellowa good throw begin in the athlete leg but to deliver the ball they need arm that are strong and limber thats why professional shotputters spend every week doing gymnastics the critical move is a giant in which the men leap up and rotate their pound body around the high bar which bend under the strain those workout supplement hefty weight session in which they bench press more than pound and squat when he want a challenge crouser follows his girlfriend to yogaonce theyre done the work isnt over thats when it is time to eatboth men eat so much food at least five full meal a day no fewer than calorie at each that it becomes a chorei dont even like food anymore crouser said each one of my meal is half of what a normal person eats in a day and i do that five time if i ever feel hungry during the day that mean im not doing my job so i eat all the time sometimes before another meal ill stare at it for a while like this againhis girlfriend becomes angry at him for pushing food around on his plate so hell take shortcut like eating a large pizza with three meat topping from domino he chase every meal with ounce of milk it an easy way to get calorie he said now that i think about it thats actually a lot of milk eighty ounce or more than half a gallon kovacs who is but roughly pound start every day with a carton of scrambled egg when youre eating a dozen egg at once theyve got to be scrambled he explained dinner is no le than a pound of meat measured after cooking looking more like linebacker and lumberjack than the runner they hang out with can lead to indignity when shotputters win there are no water cooler shower instead after his victory at the millrose game crouser received a bouquet of white flower that wa smaller than one of his arm and most teammate are not exactly on the calorie regimen sometimes when we travel the meal will be catered to runner salad and a premade plate with half a chicken breast and a quarter cup of rice crouser said we tell them we need like eight of theseso crouser and kovacs will head out together for a second dinner and then sometimes a third weighing more than twice a much a some of their teammate can have it benefit when traveling they have to fit on the plane somehow my shoulder will hang out the aisle and bang every time the beverage cart come by said crouser whose shoulder measure a seat and a half wide in coach so i find a seat by a distance runner forget sitting next to each other picture preteen in car seatsthere are other adjustment to make outside the track rare is the men wear brand that outfit a man with a waisttothigh ratio of popeyei have to buy huge pant to fit my quad in them and then use a belt to cinch it all together said kovacs whose waist is and whose thigh are well enormous ive blown out the quad of so many pantsits not all hard work crouser discovered one day that he wielded a sledgehammer with a lot of power too so he started a video series built around smashing thing that mostly involved a progressive holiday theme featuring canned pumpkin a christmas ornament and a snow globe with an audience engagement strategy of asking viewer to suggest future target he called it gettin smashed with ryan crouser the title is literal like kovacs crouser rarely drinksafter the millrose game in a booth at a restaurant near the track they ingested the last of the day calorie allotment and held court for the tiny but passionate cohort that identifies a fan of shotput some sent plastic cup of beer that the athlete politely allowed to pile up on the table others approached for autograph of the meet book cover which featured a picture of kovacs wow your entire autograph fit over your biceps one admirer observedit had been a good day organizer showcased their event in the center of the track it been cool because these day we go to random place and we throw shot like on a main street or by a monument and people seem really into it they connect crouser said there are few professional sport

mentioned their child had gone to uscits usually hi how you doing said keith muirhead a real estate broker who ha lived in the house one door down for year muirhead described heinel a friendly but said that they had never socialized never had a glass of wine which is unusual because in naples it almost a ruleits not clear when exactly heinel developed a relationship with singer but since heinel had presented to admission more than two dozen student with bogus athletic credential including a football player whose high school had no football team a well a a foot men basketball player and a high school cheerleader made to look like a lacrosse star in fact email and recorded phone conversation in the indictment paint a portrait of heinel not merely a a conduit but also a a fixer who could spot potential brush fire and swept aside skeptical questionswhen counselor at two high school reviewing application to usc last april raised question with parent about the listed athletic qualification of their child heinel called singer in a voice mail message captured by investigator she warned that the indignant parent must be stopped from going to the high school yelling at

not have a water polo team he played at la water polo club during the school year and traveled internationally with a youth junior team in the summer playing in greece serbia and portugal none of this

player she then thanked the admission director for raising the discrepancy sloane did not play for uscthe admission director replied to heinel thanking her and saying that a paraphrased version of her email would be passed along to assure the high school official that usc had looked into the matter they seemed unusually skeptical the director wrotethere seemed to be no such skepticism of heinel at uscthrough her year at the school she grew increasingly powerful controlling two area that were crucial to coach admission and budget that reputation helped lead to her ascent colleague saidpat haden

on the mission to empower athlete to succeed on the highest level on the grandest stage and doing so in an environment that provides them the safety the resource and the tool they need to be successful in that adventurethe second is ensuring that athlete have a voice and a seat at the table a the organization is making decision they have to play a critical part not only on the field of play but off the field of playthe third is striving for an environment in the olympic movement thats free of abuse there some work thats been done work thats being done and work that we need to dothe fourth is focusing on stewarding the olympic and paralympic movement in this country a we think about our role on the global stageexcerpts from the interview with hirshland are below do you need federal funding at this point for decade you got no federal funding is it time to say we need to get a lot of money from the federal governmentone of the thing i hope to do is identify the revenue gap between the size of the pie today and what we think a reasonable size of the pie could and should be to provide the funding to all of the athlete who have the capability to compete at the olympic and paralympic level there is a revenue gap if every athlete who had the talent to compete had the tool they needed what would that number bei cant tell you today what that revenue gap is then the question becomes whats the best way to fill it will you push for government funding for the u center for safesportevery meeting ive had in washington ive asked for money for the center for safesport how muchwe asked for it wa before my time i think million a year what came back wa million over five yearsi dont think there an easy answer that say yes the government going to fund this to this amount and here where it going to come from we dont have any confidence that real funding is going to come at this point i would think it would be a priority to get it funded properly because it sadly underfundedthe center asked u for million next year we said yes they havent come back and said we need more money there are coach that have been banned who are still coaching these guy are still out there source have said they put in a complaint to safesport and no one got back to them they probably need a lot more money not only for policing but educationthere is no doubt that the capacity of the center is not where it need to be to handle the volume my understanding is that they are growing and hiring a fast a they can funding is not the issue it capacity and growth rate it a huge priority for u but at the same time it an independent organization thats accountable to it board we have given them every dollar they have asked for if safesport need more money i certainly hope that they will ask for it there still fallout from all the lawsuit are you confident the usoc will survive will it have to declare bankruptcyi am confident based on the information i have today that we will be able to resolve the litigation and be strong and healthy a we go forwardwe take the litigation and our responsibility very seriously the olympic movement failed these athlete and we absolutely have a moral and ethical obligation how have the sponsorship changed have you had trouble gaining new sponsorship or lost a lot of sponsorshipswe have not it been a natural process sometimes a sponsor doesnt renew and you add a new sponsor thats a natural evolution the number and the revenue are not markedly different whats an early look at the los angeles olympics are people going to be excited about labased on really early measure the answer is absolutely yes the energy around it is very positive but this will ebb and flow were still a little bit in the honeymoon of the news that it coming youre interfacing with a troubled movement internationally theyre getting turned down by city there ha been enormous corruption it a troubled model how do you fit into that is there a larger existential problemand yet there are thousand of athlete whose life are changed for the better constantly by this movement there no doubt there are two side to the coin you cant get too focused on the side you just described that you lose sight of the side i choose to spend more time thinking aboutfundamentally the olympics and sport in general are about breaking down barrier and uniting people the complexity of the system continue to expose challenge and the need for changewe have to set the example and we have to play better ourselves we cant possibly solve all of that if we dont have our own house in order do you think the current olympic model work every four year having a new city hosting the olympicsits fiscally not responsible to create the infrastructure for an olympic game just for an olympic game that cant work a city ha to either need the infrastructure and use the olympics to accelerate it development or the infrastructure ha to exist the notion that were going to go here and build the infrastructure for the olympics is not sustainableas we looked at opportunity for the winter game thats an incredibly compelling reality of salt lake city there is not a construction requirement there to host an olympic game are there other city in the pipelinewe have been very clear in selecting salt lake to not encourage other city to prepare to host a winter game we have determined that salt lake is our best foot forward for the winter and we are not even contemplating summer beyond la how confident are you that la will make a profiti feel really good about la it year out but the fundamental economic model is really strong because the infrastructure is where the huge part of the cost is and the infrastructure wa either there or wa already in the plan to be built a part of la natural development under your predecessor the staff of the usoc would get bonus depending on the performance of the athlete at the olympics is that a good modelone of the thing ive changed is the staff incentive model for there is still a component of athletic success but it is much more based on a variety of component what ha the last six month been likei logged mile in my first five month i had to make choice about going deep or going broad i went really broad and met a lot of people at a cursory level now im starting to home in on prioritiesit feel now like a manageable intake like i have enough space mentally and time to start to take control and implement changethe only way i can be good and strong for the organization is to keep myself strong mentally and physically im working hard to make sure this doesnt consume mei cant be fearful on this job being fearful on this job is not a recipe for successthis interview ha been edited and condensedadvertisement
advertisementsupported bythe time collegiate national champion is now and trying to figure out exactly who he is and which country he will represent by matthew futtermanfor year now nearly a decade ed chesereks path seemed obviousa gifted teenage runner from kenya he had become a high school sensation at st benedict prep in newark and then a star at the university of oregon a distance specialist cheserek could win race a long a meter or drop down and a run a subfourminute mile a needed cheserek won national championship at oregon and when he graduated in he wa the most decorated runner in ncaa historyhis next move seemed clear he would become an american citizen and represent the country in the biggest distance race and the biggest competition the way other runner born in africa bernard lagat meb keflezighi abdi abdirahman had done before himit ha not gone that way not yet anyway instead cheserek now and back in new york this week to run in the wanamaker mile at the millrose game is caught between two country trapped in a dispute involving immigration law specialized work visa and the strange question of just how elite a runner he can claim to be all this is unfolding a cheserek evolves trying to become the runner he ha always wanted to be like plenty of other somethings he is learning that the path to what he want is rarely a straight or a simple a it once seemedhe ha moved to flagstaff ariz where he train at elevation alongside some of the best distance runner in the world it feel like home he said but his application for a green card ha been rejected even receiving a temporary work visa something that seemed a if it would be simple given his elite skill ha proved difficult his lawyer us stronger word to describe the process arbitrary and capricious though he said the difficulty went back to the year of the obama presidencyall i can do is just keep running until they decide what they decide cheserek said in a telephone interview this weekmostly he ha been very good at that cheserek ran the secondfastest indoor mile ever last year finishing in minute second at the david hemery valentine invitational in boston but he is certain his greatest success will come in the and the just foot but with the chiseled physique of an undersize nfl cornerback cheserek ha a stride that regardless of how fast he is running make him appear to float across any distance other than the slightest roll of his shoulder he is a model of what look like effortless efficiency then in an instant he produce his trademark burst of speed that throughout college at least almost always left his competition far behindhes a kind of freakish combination of strength and speed said stephen haas who ha been coaching cheserek for the past yearit is also what set him apart consider keflezighi for example the winner of the new york city and boston marathon and a versatile athlete who like cheserek won national championship in crosscountry and at and meter in college keflezighi ha never broken four minute for the mile mo farah widely considered the world most versatile distance runner ha never run a mile faster than cheserek though ha plenty of ground to make up in the longer distance before he can be considered world class in those event where even his best time are second off the world record in the and more than two minute behind the mark in the to be fair cheserek ha yet to have a complete and healthy outdoor season a a professional haas said he wa certain an injuryfree cycle of training that now included mileplus week and faster longer run a cheserek headed into the spring and summer wa going to produce significant breakthrough at the distance cheserek belief are his specialtya glimpse of the future may have occurred at the manchester road race in connecticut on a frigid thanksgiving morning last fall when the runner known a king cheserek at oregon set a course record he ran the mile course in beating paul chelimo the meter silver medalist at the rio olympics and andy butchart a british olympian by secondsso doe he now prefer the road to the track road track i dont care cheserek said running is runningexactly what country he will represent is a much more complex question thomas young a colorado immigration lawyer who ha represented many athlete and now oversees chesereks citizenship case said the process had become much le predictable since before president trump wa electedcheserek ha said since high school that his dream is to become an american citizen and to represent the united state in the olympics it should be noted that american distance running team are usually easier to make than kenyan one though chesereks indoor mile time last year set a kenyan recordchesereks current challenge is that he attended oregon on a student visa and wa not able to obtain a green card while he wa there young said after oregon he applied for a green card seeking approval on the basis of his athletic accomplishment but wa told he had not proved himself against pro runner if ncaa championship wont get you a green card nothing will young saiduntil cheserek ha a green card the clock can not start ticking on the five year he ha to wait before he can apply for united state citizenship an act of congress could expedite that process but not much else so if cheserek approaching his prime want to appear at this year world championship or next year olympics in tokyo he will have to do it running for kenya a later switch of nationality is allowed under international track and field rulesin the meantime young ha helped cheserek obtain a p visa more commonly referred to a the athlete and artist visa it allows people who can demonstrate extraordinary talent to live and work in the united state for up to five year because their profession require the participation of the best people in the world think of foreignborn nba star and virtuoso violinistsin january the united state citizenship and immigration service which doe not comment on individual case granted cheserek a p visa for only one year rather than fivean application to extend his visa is still under review immigration official have questioned whether the track meet and race cheserek wa participating in really required athlete of international recognition a the statute state young said the concern about chesereks schedule were unfounded because the event he wanted to run which included the new balance indoor grand prix the millrose game and the prefontaine classic were among the most prestigious meet in the world so of course they required the service of internationally recognized athletescheserek ha until april to file additional information he is allowed to continue living and training in the united state until the case is decided which may take several monthsuntil then all he can do is run the best result he can hope for is the path of lagat who attended washington state lagat began his career running for kenya but then represented the united state after gaining citizenshipthese athlete have a very short window of time to compete at the highest level internationally said chris lane chesereks agent we dont want to restrict ed from accomplishing his goal and those include medal in the world and the olympicsadvertisement

baseball penthouse he could earn a munificent contract of the sort handed out to bryce harper million and manny machado million these past two week but he see many dozen of ballplayer who have fallen

very outspoken about their opinion he said baseball ha always been about giving the generic cliché answer that keep you guessing basketball player are much more outspoken and go into it with a lot of

monthhe had been assigned a locker in the clubhouse and on monday morning oakland official had expressed hope that murray would soon slip into his no jerseybob melvin the a manager said he wa cautiously optimistic that murray would choose baseball according to the san francisco chronicle yet realistically those hope had been dimming since murray declared for the nfl draft on jan the a

jackson of course did not play quarterback an allconsuming position that leaf no room for distraction to maximize his appeal to team and his potential for success murray chose football exclusively

have been a a baseball player he could always try the sport again if football fizzle a tim tebow is doing with the mets but baseball a an institution doe not give itself the best chance to attract an athlete like murray whose bonus potential wa limited by the strict draftslotting system instituted in the draft system ha always incentivized losing to some extent in and the washington national plotted a new course by taking stephen strasburg and bryce harper first over all in consecutive draft but by awarding a fixed amount of bonus money to team with the worst team getting by far the

have spawned so many imitator that a record eight team tallied loss last seasonthe player union ha been dismayed by this trend which ha lessened demand and therefore salary for veteran free agent

comment publiclyhowever the deal is calculated either an additional million over year or the angel total commitment of about million for the next year trout ha eclipsed the previous record for guaranteed money the year million deal bryce harper signed this month with the philadelphia philliesthe extension which wa first reported by espn would establish trout a the highestpaid baseball player on an annual basis topping the million zack greinke is earning from the arizona diamondback on a sixyear million contract signed in december from mike trout baseball best without the brandwhile it is an enormous amount of money even this recordbreaking contract doesnt necessarily bring trout into the highest tier of overall income for professional athleteswhile comparing contract across sport and continent is an inherently difficult undertaking because of varied contractual structure tax burden bonus and ancillary benefit it is clear that even with the monster deal trout would fall well short of becoming the world highest paid athlete annuallythe soccer superstar lionel messi for example is expected to earn more than million euro about million per year from barcelona through an amount that could rise to million euro if certain incentive are met the boxer canelo álvarez will earn at least million annually from a fiveyear deal with the streaming service dazntrout also wont

bennerand singer begin to help the fbijennifer medinahe agrees to wear a wire he agrees to go back to the client that he worked with for year and tape in excruciating detail what he done he agrees to call all these people he worked with people he accepted bribe from and people he given bribe to some of these are parent some of these are coach some of these are associate people he paying off in one way or anotherkatie bennertheyre discussing extremely strange bizarre extraordinary measure that very very few people could imagine ever taking in order to get their kid into schooljennifer medinatheres sort of two different way that he operates the first is this athletic scheme where he amasses a number of coach at a number of different school more than a dozen school who agree to accept his bribe and say i want this person on my team all these coach get special slot for athlete they get admitted to university on a totally different track than anybody who not an athletemichael barbaroso these coach are communicating with the admission department at these college theyre almost getting like their own personal bucket of student athletesjennifer medinaabsolutely thats exactly the way it work you get to say this is who i want on my team and the admission office essentially agrees to go along with what you say so he paying off these coach in all these different collegesmichael barbaroand how do the coach pretend that someone is a legitimate athlete when theyre not and how do the parent play along with that a welljennifer medinaso he had a very elaborate scheme in lot of case one of his typical way of operating apparently wa to fake photo in one case he said i need a picture of an asian girl playing soccer and were going to photoshop the applicant face onto this photomichael barbarowowjennifer medinaalmost every case that we know about this person never played on the team they would drop out a soon a they arrived on campus in some case the kid didnt even know that they were expected to play on this team they created a profile saying that this kid ran track and he get to campus and is speaking to a college counselor and the counselor say oh so i see you run track and the kid say what are you talking about he didnt even knowmichael barbarook so thats one scam this kind of sport coaching method scam what wa the other scam that the fbi discoveredkatie bennerhe talked about how he arranged for student to take their sat or act exam at special site where he had bribed the proctor on those test to basically correct the student answer he talked about how he encouraged the parent to get their child tested for disability so that they could have more time to complete the exam he talked about how he would sometimes even have a man an adult pose a the student at the test center that he quote unquote controlled and that adult would take the test for the kid and this guy wa so good at it he could basically get any score that they wantedmichael barbarojenny and katie youve described an elaborate system of wealthy parent bribing their childrens way into college arent there le risky way for rich people to get their child into collegejennifer medinathe world of college admission for the extremely wealthy is really complicated so there are three way to get in first youve got the front door there test there grade there your extracurricular activity your achievement there also the issue of legacy if your parent went to this college youre trying to get to youll probably get some extra point if you play a sport you might get some extra point so you can be on their team thats the front door and then there the back doorkatie bennerthere are so many legal way that the ultrawealthy have been gaming the system for a long time to get their kid into school they donate tremendous amount of money they help people build building and work on development projectsjennifer medinaand this is also the world where you have incredibly highend tutoring this is not just spending a couple hour learning how to navigate an sat this is hundred of thousand of dollar many time over year to come up with all sort of elaborate way to brand yourself essentially into something that you think will get you into the right college whatever you consider the right college to be so then there this third door what singer referred to a a side door which is essentially just bribingkatie bennercheatingjennifer medinacutting out the middleman or cutting out the pretense of anything other than paying people off and bribery and i think the reason why this case is so fascinating and were sitting here talking about it and everybody is so interested in it is the difference between these two door the side door and the back door now if youre the fbi that line is very clear it clear that it is completely illegal to simply bribe somebody to get your kid into the college of your choice but if youre one of these parent where youre operating in a world where you know many people are paying ten of thousand of dollar or hundred of thousand of dollar to university in an often successful attempt to get your kid into the college then maybe this doesnt seem so strangekatie bennercertainly we know it breaking the law and certainly you can tell from the recording that were transcribed by the prosecutor that the parent knew they were breaking the law but they also dont act like breaking the law is a completely big deal and they seem to operate in a parallel universe with different consequence for themjennifer medinathey knew that this crossed a line they did it anyway the why of why they did it anyway is actually really interesting and really complicated it not a though if these kid went to college their income potential wa going to grow enormouslymichael barbarobecause theyre already richjennifer medinatheyre already wealthy and study have shown that people who go to college and are already coming in with wealth do not necessarily see a huge jump in their income over a lifetime on the other hand thats not true for kid who come from poorer family there is a lot that show especially if you go to a highly selective college and if youre successful there lot of thing that show your income potential go way up it is a path to the middle class thats what weve always thought of college a being a path to the middle class but it not clear that if youre already part of the mostupper class that you need to go to some specific college to stay in that upper classmichael barbaroso why then why do these parent who can afford to participate in this kind of scam why do it if there no tangible benefit why take that riskjennifer medinai dont think it about economics that might be part of it or they might tell themselves that it part of it but it is obviously at least somewhat about status about maybe being able to put that sticker on the back of your car that say my student go to yale university maybe it that you want to give your kid some perfect social experience that you think theyre going to have at this right school or maybe you just want to save your kid embarrassment clearly these parent didnt have a lot of faith in their kid and whats also really fascinating here is that it not just ivy league school yale is of course the one that is sort of eyepopping and there stanford and there all sort of elite school there also ucla but there also school like wake forest university and university of texas at austin all school that they might have been just fine getting into on their own and are not school that we think of a holding a lot of cachet in these elite circle so what wa that about why were they so willing to spend so much money and so much effort and break the law to get into school we really dont know the answer to that yetkatie benneranother way to look at it from the point of view of the parent is that no matter what their motivation are whether they be social or whether they want an education for their child that they believe is the best education that money can buy they have this feeling that the kid face really long odds college ha never been more competitive i think that harvard accepted about percent of all of the student who applied last year and they understand that college are also looking for a wide array of student a well they dont want a class just packed with all of the people who can pay full tuition donate a million dollar to a development fund and continue to give for the rest of their life because theyre extremely wellheeled theyre looking for something more and they might worry that their student are not extraordinary enough to get in and so theyre going to use the money that they have to try to offset not a systemic inequity like socioeconomic inequity or racial inequity but to offset their childrens own inability to get injennifer medinaa lot of it seems to be about the certainty of it about the security it not a question of maybe you will or wont get into this school it im going to make sure that you have a spot at this specific school that you want to be at that i know i can get you into and i am going to be able to breathe a sigh of relief or celebrate or congratulate you much earlier with much more confidence than i would if i had gone through the front door or even if i had gone through the back doormichael barbaroand where do these privileged kid who were actually implicated in this scheme where do they fit into all of thisarchived recordingi dont know how much of school im going to attend but im going to go in and talk to my dean and everyone and hope that i can try and balance it all but i do want the experience of like game day partying i dont really care about schooljennifer medinaso the kid whose parent participated in this scheme are fascinating it is clear that some of them knew what wa going on but many of them didnt many of them are probably waking up this week stunned to learn the great length that their parent not only went through to cheat on their behalf but the great length they went to to hide it from themkatie bennerthe parent worked so hard to keep their child from knowing what wa going on and this creates a whole other layer of privilege that we see in education that we see in business that we see that these adult parent certainly had in spade this idea that if you do not know all of the wind at your back pushing you forward helping you along you will believe that you deserve everything that you gotjennifer medinatheyve been operating under the assumption that they earned their spot they deserve it and i think this is forcing u to have a conversation to think about what doe deserving it really mean what this ha done is really laid bare for all of u to see in plain view how unequal the system truly is that if you have enough money you can buy your way in but at the same time there are thousand of student who are taking out massive loan to come in and are desperate to get into higher education which our country ha long believed is the way to get into the middle and upper class it supposed to be this system based on your academic merit thats going to give you a path to get from wherever you started from to where you want to be but what weve seen is thats not true if you believe that education and that a college education specifically is the great equalizer or can be the great equalizer of our country what this show you is that that system is completely brokenkatie bennerits difficult to think of a scenario that speaks more clearly to the idea of inequityjennifer medinawhat this really show is that there all sort of way people have been using money and power and influence in this system for year that is completely legal and completely accepted and it perpetuated every single admission cyclemichael barbarojenny medina katie benner thank you both very muchjennifer medinathank youkatie bennerthank youmichael barbarosince the fbi revealed the bribery scheme on tuesday at least three college coach from stanford the university of texas and the university of southern california have been either fired or placed on leave

then there a back door where people go to institutional advancement and make large donation but theyre not guaranteed in mr singer said and then i created a side door that guaranteed family to get in

birthed a child in whatever fashion deserves her own espn highlight reel blood sweat tear and the eventual triumph of holding her newborn baby to be clear childbirth isnt a game you cant plead with the referee when you dont like a call or leave the field when youre tired still a a lifelong athlete i saw childbirth especially an unmedicated one a the ultimate challenge of physical endurance mental stamen and my ability to handle painwhen i became pregnant in january and set about preparing for the monumental task of birthing a human i loaded up on prenatal vitamin kept a daily routine of birthing stretch and exercise and endured an eightweek birthing course an image of the lead female competitor in the new york city marathon who bring me to tear when they run past my brooklyn apartment each year filled me with confidence for labor washboardlike ab lean leg showing off every strand of muscle calm focused and confident expression on their faceshowever a my due date came near i clung to a fear of pain and the unknown out of my control how long would my labor be would my mind fall apart what if my pelvis wasnt the optimal shape or i stopped dilatingi wanted to face childbirth with the same kind of confidence that radiated from the runner i admired so i turned to sport psychology for advicethe field typically us a hodgepodge of method like cognitive behavioral therapy and attention control training to improve athletic performance and competitor experience it suit a laboring woman because it can quickly provide practical tool to achieve a specific goal said jaylee nair a singaporebased sport psychologist who work with athlete including professional golfer and olympic sailor a well a woman preparing for labor a simple strategy could be mimicking an athlete pregame routine like reciting affirmation reminding them about their game plan or the attitude they want to have she saidto help me labor like an olympian dr nair challenged my unhelpful birth belief with rational fact in the sport context an unhelpful thought could be believing a win in a tournament wa because of luck or lesser skilled competitor she saidi have a fear of operation and for me undergoing a cesarean would take more gut than an unmedicated labor dr nair advised me to gather positive cesarean story for a process called cognitive restructuring in which factbased alternative statement dispute the irrational belief i wa under the impression that a mother could not pick up her child for six week after a cesarean but many of my friend assured me that they could within daysit is hard just like a natural birth is hard and youre still amazing for going through that dr nair saidjoan steidinger a sport psychologist based in the bay area and a former ultramarathon runner told me to develop a mindfulness plan by identifying the extremely difficult moment in labor the minute cab ride to the hospital under the onslaught of contraction topped my list and to design a predetermined meditation for each she used this strategy when she prepared runner for the western state mile endurance run in which the track go through canyon with stagnant degree air you might visualize a cool waterfall something to take your mind off the situation said dr steidingeri still wondered how athlete reframe their mind if something doesnt go a planned midcompetition how doe a figure skater shift from aiming for gold to finishing her fourminute routine with dignity when she doesnt land a jump that took month of practice what we usually do is create some kind of action they do to refocus because an action connects mind and body said caroline silby a former figure skater turned sport psychologist that could mean pushing down on the ice or drawing a deep breath to move beyond failure dr silby saidthe physical cue i developed to help me reframe midlabor started with clenched fist during an inhale and then opening them during an exhale with my palm up in a surrender i would surrender to the difficult moment or to whatever my body needed for a safe birth whether that wa every intervention under the sun or nothing at allthe idea of pain with a purpose is common in sport and labor so are breathing technique and visualization to cope visualization didnt do it for me but breathing did during my birth class i figured out what i liked a long loud exhale where i focused on the vibrating hum inside my mouth i practiced this a few time each week while holding a piece of ice it surprisingly painful dr silby added a tip stay present and enjoy the rest between contraction much a a marathon runner turn a downhill section into active recovery if youre anticipating the next painful push during recovery that is a waste she saidafter an anxious and tearful day beyond my due date contraction started on a monday evening labor quickly became a familiar rhythm not unlike my favorite workout of highintensity interval training where say a minute of squat is followed by a second breakby am my contraction were down to three minute apart our cue to head to the hospital excitement anticipation and then my labor stalled i used my physical cue releasing clenched fist again and again to move beyond the disappointmentmy mind held it together until around midday why did my stupid body slow the contraction at the same physical and mental crossroad in a soccer match i would have raised my hand for a substitution so a more energized teammate could finish what i started but this wa labor i wa the only one who could birth this babyafter some bleeding at pm my obstetrician advised me to come into the hospital i assumed i had hour left and that beautiful thought epidural appeared on the horizon however my body had other ideaswhen i got in the cab my contraction were minute apart when i got out the contraction were coming every two minute and my water had broken yes in the cab minute later i wa in a labor room i pushed the obstetrician pulled my doula held my leg back and my mom propped my head up it wa freeing to finally enlist some brute strengthafter almost hour of labor and half an hour of pushing just minute after arriving at the hospital i had my slimy alert and at pound ounce very large sonthe strategy borrowed from sport psychology got me somewhat gracefully through labor but they are not foolproof like serena williams at this year united state open final even elite athlete have their trying moment i did too just a i entered the homestretch of my laborless than two week after the birth i stood on the stoop to watch the

often referred to a the henry ford of the italian fashion industrylike ford mr bianchi wa singleminded to the point of obsession about efficiency and streamlined production he measured his own quotidian ritual with a chronometer organizing his regimen according to a schedule that allotted two minute each morning for shaving and exactly enough time at breakfast to consume grapesin reality a his grandson andrea benedini said he preferred to eat more yet removing the detested seed proved too time consuming so he designed a special utensil part knife and part spoon that allowed him to reach his preferred allowance of grape a daymr bianchi died in having built his modest family business into an industrial empire and been rewarded for his effort by a knighthood conferred by the italian government the company he left behind is still run according to his belief that every action in life is repeated in an unending loop he wa obsessed most of all with statistic said mr benedini the international export manager for lubiam the parent company of lbm organization wa the key word for him not only for business but for lifeefficient assembly line method are hardly the stuff of fashion innovation and mr benedini is the first to say that his men wear label may be by some light boringwe dont like a jacket with pocket and a hole in the back mr benedini said if you look at our collection the model are pretty much the same each seasonbut that is not exactly the case while a label specializing in subtle modification by season the current one feature luxurious cotton corduroy and herringbone knit and themeandvariation is never going to become instagram catnip in the age of like and follower but there something stealthily sexy about the lowkey way that lbm ha built a clientele without the aid of influencers or salaried peacock or guccistyle fripperyguys have really embraced this deconstructed concept said steven ramenofsky the general merchandise manager of gary a specialty men wear retailer in newport beach calif sure other label make soft jacket mr ramenofsky said citing betterknown brand like canali or boglioli or peter millar all of which cost considerably

everything in between sport allows u to admire the awesomeness of the human body and the artistry of athlete in action and to explore story of grit and resilience and our need for hero and villainswhile it might not be immediately obvious to all teacher particularly those who arent diehard fan sport is also an endless source of inspiration for making argument and throwing down factsin this lesson we explore how to use the world of sport to help student effectively develop evidencebased argument we suggest three category for practicing the skill in sport context from making a case for the goat to taking on current sportsworld controversy to proposing rule change to make a sport or tournament better we end the lesson with a few strategy for bringing debate and argument writing alive in the classroomdo you teach with sport reporting wed love to hear your idea post a comment or write to lnfeedbacknytimescom_________who is the goatno not those cute animal with the horn and the beard the greatest of all timeno matter how seemingly impossible it is to determine the goat it is a perennial favorite argument for sport fan and is debated regularly in the new york timesthe goat argument come in many form best game best season best coach best team greatest upset greatest olympian even best and worst sport citiesbut how do you decide is it the accomplishment on the playing field or is it a player greater impact beyond his or her sport how do you compare one era to anotheris tom brady the greatest football player of all time who would you pick michael jordan or lebron james is serena williams the greatest athlete of all time or is it muhammad alijesse owen won four gold medal in the munich olympics in broke or equaled nine olympic record also set three world record and singlehandedly shattered adolf hitler myth of aryan superiority yet his record mark of second in the meter would today be foot behind usain bolt record of would it be more fair to incorporate broader cultural accomplishment or should the greatest of all time focus solely on the numbersstudent challenge make your case for the goatfirst ask your student to decide which aspect of the goat debate they would like to tackle greatest play season game coach athlete et ceteranext they should define their criterion for greatness doe greatest mean the player you want to be up at bat in the seventh game of the world series two out in the bottom of the ninth is it instead the number of an athlete victory his or her longevity the relative strength of the competition the athlete impact within a well a beyond the sportadvance evidencebased argument and tackle counterargument use a model text or two to help student move from mere assertion or opinion to rigorous evidencebased argument here are a few excerpt to highlight how author both support claim with evidence and anticipate counterargumentsin is russell westbrooks season the best ever some apple and orange to pick from jeré longman support his claim with evidence using sport statisticswestbrooks season while awesome is not the greatest in nba history that belongs to none other than wilt chamberlain in with the philadelphia warrior chamberlain averaged point and rebound that season and this may be the greatest stat in all of sport minute played per game regulation game last minute but the warrior played seven game that extended for at least one period of overtime during that game regular season chamberlain played of philadelphia possible minuteson march chamberlain famously scored point against the knicks but that wa only the culmination of a fourgame stretch in which he scored and point in the three previous game according to basketballreferencecom all told he scored at least point time that season including a stunning performance on dec against the lakers in which chamberlain delivered point and reboundsin it time to appreciate serena williams greatness christopher clarey anticipates counterargumentsin light of that and williams enduring excellence there is momentum building behind the concept of deeming her the greatest player ever it is a subjective process one in which it is always tempting to give too much weight to the great champion in front of you the one whose victory under pressure is freshest in your mindwhat is beyond dispute is that williams ha not been nearly a consistent in regular tour event during her career a player like navratilova chris evert and grafnavratilova won single title a well a double title in an era when double wa much more prestigious than now evert won single title graf who did not play a long a williams ha played won williams for the moment ha which put her in a tie for sixth on the career list with billie jean king but if greatest mean the player who would have beaten all the rest at their peak it is hard not to feel a strong pull in williams direction her power serving and her serving under pressure are weapon that no other great player ha possessed to the same degree modern equipment is certainly a factor but she is also complete off the ground and guided by her coach patrick mouratoglou improving her volley overhead and tactical variationstogether the class might analyze how these author develop their case for goat for example by defining their term for greatness providing evidence to support claim and anticipating and then considering potential counterclaimshere are additional resource from the time and elsewhere that can provide alternative mentor textsthe fine line what make simone bile the world

right answer to the goat question to some jesse owen will always be the goat for his cultural impact for others bill russell nba championship will trump all other measure but that is the beauty of the debate and in the end it about the power of the argument to persuade others at least for that day who is the greatest of all time_________should athlete who use steroid be barred from professional sport should player have the right to kneel during the national anthem should college athlete be paidthese are just a few of the countless debate that come and go in the world of sport any one of them is ripe for student to investigate and debate to practice their inquiry and argument skillsin this section we present three sportsrelated case study to demonstrate how student can develop good research question assert a strong claim and study mentor text a a way to improve their debate writing and speaking skill and these three topic are just the tip of the iceberg at the end of the section we suggest another current issue in sport for student to explore and were confident your student would have plenty more topic to add to our listcase study sport and concussionssports are often associated with heroism endurance toughness and valor it ha long been assumed that an athlete will have to make physical sacrifice to achieve greatness but the sacrifice is now being questioned because of change in our understanding of the impact sport can have on our body and mindsthe brain trauma sustained in football and other contact sport is now linked to longterm cognitive impairment including memory loss confusion depression and dementia although medium coverage of concussion ha focused on tackle football these health issue are evident in many other sport like hockey soccer basketball nascar skiing snowboarding and bmx freestyle among othersthe debate is not merely academic it is causing significant change to our understanding of athlete and athletics and is threatening the future viability of some of the world most popular sportsdevelop winning questionsresearch generally begin with asking good question even a topic a seemingly straight forward a sportsrelated concussion ha many layer of complexity so student should begin their research by asking themselves what about this topic interest me most what do i want to learn more aboutfor example if they want to start with the science they might generate question like what is the impact of a single concussion what is the longterm impact of brain trauma what is the degenerative brain disease cte and what is the impact of concussion on youthsor they may instead decide to investigate the role equipment play look into possible reform or consider ethical implication if they decide to go in any of these direction they might come up with question like how do concussion affect athlete short and longterm physical and mental health how doe this affect the people around them what is the role of equipment in brain trauma can equipment reduce concussion or doe it give player a false sense of security therefore making the problem worse should parent let their child play football or are we obsessing about the danger should we a fan still watch footballno matter what question or question student start with research inevitably lead to asking more questionssome other relevant resource nfl brain all but

ceremony at the olympics following the fatal shooting of trayvon martin lebron james dwyane wade and the other member of the miami heat posted a photo of themselves wearing hooded sweatshirt in his memory but perhaps no act of political protest today is more polarizing than the stance by colin kaepernick to kneel during the national anthem at nfl gamesif student want to argue a position related to recent national anthem protest they should start by asking a question for example should athlete have the right to kneel during the national anthem or are athlete who protest being patriotic or unpatriotic a student do research they will gather evidence that will support a position once they find enough compelling evidence they are ready to assert a claim or thesis or resolutionassert a claim in small group or a a whole class student can debate one or more claim that were generated by student or the teacher after they have the opportunity to test their argument with their peer and hear other point of view they can write up their argument a an essay or editorialbelow are a few possible resolution that student can affirm or negate with related article belowresolution the nfl ha

essential aspect of making an effective argument is the need to be clear and precise in defining term we discussed earlier about how one defines goat frame the entire greatest of all time debate the same can be said for defining term like performanceenhancing drug in the debate about steroid or patriotic in the discussion about national anthem protest when it come to deciding what should or should not be considered a sport or an olympic sport defining the term sport is essentialstudents might begin by reading the following article and then designing their own criterion for what is or

winter olympic sport see the full list of sport here did you know life saving is officially recognized by the international olympic committee a a sport though a victor mather writes that doesnt mean it will take it place in the summer game alongside venerable sport like track basketball and synchronized swimmingstudents can begin their research with the following examplesare video game olympic

the change would affect the sport from all angle in guiding their research for the development of their proposal student should keep in mind the following question what are some weakness of the current game eg amount of scoring length or speed of the game popularity and rating what are the cause of the weakness eg tradition the age of the fan base technology what are some possible solution

try to persuade them to join your sidein penaltykick shootout are a world cup abomination rob hughes passionately state a perceived problem in the current game of soccerthe penalty shootout is an abomination it reduces a team sport to a contrived tiebreaker that obliges physically tired and emotionally drained player to step up one by one trudge half the length of the field and try to shoot down the opponent goalkeeper from yardsjúlio césar soares de espíndola to give him his full title guessed correctly and dove the right way to save the first two penalty kick against him he then wa

soccer but by the lottery of shootout that have their proper place alongside fairground game such a knocking over target at a dozen paceslater mr hughes considers some solution to the problemthe old solution used to be that tied game were replayed but in today crowded schedule expediency demand that the result is decided on that day fifa tried the toss of a coin and had rejected a brighter idea from the now defunct north american soccer leaguethe nasl of the s had to my mind a fairer optionit required an outfield player to run with the ball from yard out giving him five second to score and allowing the goalkeeper to advance toward the playerthat at least contained more skill than the single shot of a nervous fatigued individualno matter what rule they focus on student should be clear to state the problem with the status quo and support their claim with detail then they should propose a solution and explain why it would help to eliminate or at least improve the problem with the current rule_________below we provide a few possible way student can build their argument writing and speaking skill and demonstrate those skill in front of an audiencea write an editorialhave your

alghadban source photograph sean m haffeygetty imagessupported byby bruce schoenfeldhalf an hour before a preseason hockey game last fall ted leonsis strolled down the concourse of capital one arena in washington stopping every now and then to pose for someone selfie leonsis owns both the washington capital the national hockey league team and the arena itself a squat behemoth that fill a block of chinatown not far from ford theater he also owns other team that play there including the washington wizard in the national basketball association and some smaller one that dontleonsis is easily the most popular sport owner in the nation capital though the wizard have managed just one division title in his eight season and his nhl team underachieved for year it help that the capital finally won the stanley cup last season the city first championship in any major professional league in more than a quartercentury but leonsis is also uncommonly friendly to fan during his customary lap around the arena he fielded question from anyone who came up to him it wa hard to imagine many bigleague owner doing the samea middleaged africanamerican man in a capital jersey approached leonsis what about that gambling thing he asked a few month before the federal statute prohibiting sport gambling wa overturned by the supreme court this wa the first home game since a few state newly liberated to set their own gambling agenda had implemented law allowing sport bet leonsis ha been vocal about his support for legal gambling and he wa full of idea one wa a sport bar he planned to put inside the arena that would handle bet it would fit into a space currently occupied by a brewpub or perhaps displace a fitness center he envisioned betting window like those at a horse tracksports gambling wasnt yet legal in the district of columbia and until it wa there would be no betting window but leonsis is confident that they will come eventually he told me the bar will be somewhere that fan can congregate and watch game and bet on the game in whatever way they want to whether at the window or on handheld device leonsis would outsource the bookmaking because owning a team while taking bet on it game would be perceived a a conflict of interest and probably be illegal instead he would simply offer a site for eating drinking and more gambling except that i want to outlaw the word gambling he said maybe call it interactive wagering when you hear gambling you think of tony soprano im with my bookie people who bet on ncaa pool at their church they dont think theyre gambling they areleonsis who held various executive position at america online from to say he doesnt gamble not on sport or on anything else yet he ha risked both his reputation and his capital on the future of sport wagering he owns a stake in draftkings a daily sport fantasy company that ha segued into online gambling he ha invested in sportradar which delivers at high speed information on game in progress to bookmaking website creating the sort of advantage enjoyed by wall street trader who in his word get a quarter of a second more to say buy that stock he owns part of winview which hold numerous patent for various aspect of ingame gambling he hope to fill the schedule of the nbc sport washington cable channel of which he owns a third with chatter about point spread and gambling opportunity like cnbc he saysgambling on sport became explicitly legal in nevada in until recently the prospect of it spreading beyond that state border wa treated a potentially ruinous by the franchise owner and commissioner who ruled over sport they feared that it would alter the relationship between fan and their favorite team and that gambling would expose athlete to underworld character trying to manipulate game eventually the cautionary tale went the competition in even the biggest league would be indistinguishable from the manufactured plotlines of pro wrestling or oldtime roller derby gambling on sport wa already happening of course at la vega casino on illegal internet site at the corner bar yet somehow that hadnt made it more palatable even five year ago say steve murray a partner with leonsis in the venturecapital firm that ha invested in many of these business you would have had a hard time finding a single owner in any of these league saying that gambling wa a good idea you wouldnt have been able to do itsince then attitude seem to have changed abruptly it now difficult to find anyone inside sport who opposes gambling in part thats because the league and their investor have come to see how much they stand to gain but it also a result of insider like leonsis evangelizing to anyone who would listen in owner meeting in conversation with sponsor even with u congressman during a gambling conference on capitol hill he a visionary and he speaks quite eloquently about what the future opportunity are say gary bettman the nhls commissioner who until recently strongly opposed gambling on sport he ha been at the forefront of pushing u to make sure were a knowledgeable a we can be i get email on this from him daily more than dailyleonsis speaks slowly but exuberantly his conversation unfolds a logically a a business plan what are you so afraid of he like to ask anyone who seems uneasy about gambling were going to create more job were going to generate more tax while pro athlete were once paid poorly enough to make the offer of payoff enticing leonsis argues that a vast majority are today far wealthier than anyone who might tempt them i dont think an nba player is susceptible to some hustler saying shave the point and here in hundreddollar bill he saysleonsis arrived back at his suite shortly after the opening faceoff he sat down in time to see the boston bruin score a goal i mentioned that where sport wager were now legal gambler had surely placed bet both for and against the capital leonsis wanted his team to win naturally even though this preseason game didnt really count but he admitted that just the fact that those bet could be made meant that in a sense hed already wonin the middle of the th century television began reframing the way we experience sport it gave u replay and extended timeouts pushed world series game into prime time scrambled conference affiliation through national telecast and highlight and later superstations and cable network fan grew intimate with team many hundred of mile away now gambling is poised to unleash change just a transformative and they may come fast in an october report pricewaterhousecoopers estimated that a fully developed sport gambling industry in all state would draw billion in bet every year the congressional national gambling impact study commission ha suggested the figure could be closer to billion whatever the size of the jackpot league team and broadcaster will want their piece of it the player the sponsor all the stakeholder in the ecosystem can become beneficiary of this say peter guber an owner of both the golden state warrior and the los angeles dodgersthe game we watch are already enhanced by data collected through technological advance announcer tell u how hard baseball are hit and how far they travel or how many mile a particularly active soccer player ha run because such derivative create new opportunity for betting were sure to see many more of them the nba ha been advertising for a gambling data analyst on the employment website glassdoor hockey hasnt traditionally generated much in the way of metric but in order to learn who is skating the fastest or shooting the hardest the nhl is preparing to record the movement of every player during every game and even put a chip inside the puck league are building a fire hose of data around their product say chris grove an analyst who consults for gaming company and investor and the logical recipient of that data is the betting industrywhat are the chance that someone homer in the next two inning or kick a field goal in the next five minute imagine those odds sliding across the bottom of your screen like the cnn news crawl a a sport medium consultant and former nba executive named ed desser put it how doe the production and presentation of telecast change to accommodate gambling explicit reference to betting might seem jarring during a master broadcast which ha the feel of a conversation in a ritzcarlton lobby but tiger wood and phil mickelsons madefortv showdown in november which included such information gave viewer more reason to care about what happenedrealtime digital wagering ha created betting opportunity that dont rely on the score the appeal of a game in which the patriot are up by point in the fourth quarter is altogether different if you can put money down right then on how many more first down theyll get a viewer create their own narrative tension by betting on piece of the action broadcast right fee will increase and franchise value soar that tension could also be artificially created and exploited by event promoter too if youre the ufc and you have an absolute dog of a fight on a major card for whatever reason you could use odds and promotion around betting to drive fan interest grove point out you could use betting proactivelylegal gambling also open the door to an entirely new source of sponsorship income in english soccer of the team that compete in the sport top echelon wear shirt festooned with the name of bookmaking site dont be surprised to see them soon in the nba or major league soccer game will be held in venue with name like the bet bowl or caesar coliseum and be analyzed by tout on tv and subscription podcasts a you create more interest in these thing people want more information desser say and theyre always looking for an edgeperhaps nobody see more dollar sign on the horizon than legislator it remains uncertain how quickly state will continue to pas new gambling law or how broad or restrictive those will be but few dispute the potential impact i wa talking to some economic development people from alabama say jack evans a district of columbia council member who introduced a sport gambling bill there that is expected to become law in march they were asking how they could raise money i told them put in sport gambling and you can pay off all your debt on the alabamaauburn football game alone one game alabama and auburn youd make billion leonsis ha a stake in nearly all of these possibility he envisions simulcast of every wizard and capital game on nbc sport washington that will include a steady stream of betting information he control two team in the resurrected arena football league and is pitching network a gamblingcentric concept for it game thats too overt for the stodgy nfl at least for now sportradars chief executive told me he expects it billion valuation to quintuple in three year with the opening of the u market which will mean the same for leonsiss stake and if franchise value rise because of fan increased engagement in the sport they follow leonsiss nhl and nba team could be his most profitable gambling play of all in time sport betting may generate it own mark zuckerberg or jeff bezos some forwardthinking entrepreneur who come to define the zeitgeist of his generation for now though the person whose odds are a great a anyones to profit from this emerging industry is leonsis a yearold billionaire who ha been around since the early day of the world wide webthe history of regulated gambling in america go back to when nevada opened the nation first casino the state wa on the verge of bankruptcy a predicament that motivated it to defy the prevailing national sentiment against gambling any state could have done it say anthony cabot who teach gaming law at the university of nevada la vega but no others did just a pro football wa starting to thrive nevada broadened it gambling law to regulate sport bet over the next halfcentury american attitude toward gambling evolved in with great fanfare casino opened in atlantic city a decade later congress passed a law permitting them on land owned by native american tribe by a gallup poll revealed nearly half of all american had played the lottery in the previous month almost a third had visited a casino but just percent had bet on a pro sport event mostly because there were few legal way to do itnobody tried to legalize sport betting outside nevada until chris christie by the time christie became new jersey governor in atlantic city wa in trouble the novelty appeal of it casino had faded hotel booking had plummeted and taxgenerating casino revenue with them christie saw sport betting a a way to counter those loss his first year in office he pushed a referendum that would allow it at any racetrack or casino in the state the referendum passed and christie signed it into lawthere wa only one problem through the professional and amateur sport protection act of which in a somewhat curious twist had been sponsored by new jersey own bill bradley the former nba great turned senator the federal government banned sport gambling throughout the country beyond a few existing manifestation that were allowed to continue those included betting on bicycle racing in new mexico and golf in wyoming several sportsbased lottery horse racing jai alai and the bookmaking inside nevada casinosin new jersey referendum wa challenged in court by the ncaa the major sport league joined the suit a plaintiff but christie had calculated that the supreme court wouldnt uphold a law banning a recreational pursuit in state that had been legal for decade in the th and he wa right the court analyst noted wanted to make a show of limiting federal jurisdiction they just happened to pick a gambling law to do so cabot say last may verdict in what had been renamed murphy v ncaa after christie successor phil murphy surprised the gambling industry youd be amazed how many casino operator didnt see it coming say greg carlin cofounder and chief executive of rush street gaming which owns casino in pennsylvania new york and illinois it didnt surprise leonsis though hed been planning on it for yearsleonsis date his personal revelation about gambling to november when he found himself visiting the remote southwest coast of scotland his daughter who lived in london had a serious boyfriend and both family had flown in to spend thanksgiving weekend at a manor house owned by the boyfriend parent on a clear day leonsis wa told you could see ireland across the water he never could confirm that though because the weather wa never clear the basketball and hockey season were underway back home but the house had no internet or satellite reception so leonsis couldnt follow his team it wa foggy and cold there wa nothing to do he saysthe closest village of any size campbeltown wa minute away one morning they all drove in for lunch nobody seemed to be around the whole town is like two block long leonsis say and there one restaurant and a pharmacy and then we saw one place that had some life to it inside a storefront a crowd wa making noise it wa the betting parlor leonsis learned the phrase didnt carry any connotation of disrepute a it would in america it wa just this is where you go and watch a game and see your friend and hang out he said it wa the cheer of campbeltownfrom scotland leonsis went to london driving through his daughter neighborhood he noticed one betting parlor after another like in america where youd have a starbucks he say he investigated and found that you could bet on sport at outlet in the united kingdom a a comparison he looked up domino pizza and saw that it had roughly store across the united state for me that wa the beginning of hey this is a true consumer phenomenon he say the parlor seemed inviting they werent seedy haunt for professional gambler this is not offtrack betting leonsis say this is starbucks or domino this is popularized and accepted in the most remote place and the most centrally located place if you wanted to find a proxy of what could happen here you just had to look at campbeltown and londonadam silver who is now the nbas commissioner had been doing just that from to silver ran the league video production and programming on frequent business trip abroad he couldnt help noticing how pervasive gambling wa stadium had betting kiosk beside their snack bar there wa this enormous legalized infrastructure in place silver say yet somehow league and team hadnt been corrupted in fact they were thriving silver bos at the time david stern wa a lawyer who had come to the sport during college basketball betting scandal of the s throughout his tenure stern remained opposed to gambling he later changed his mind and for year even refused to hold league meeting and other event in la vega but the opportunity seemed fairly obvious to me silver saysin silver succeeded stern a nba commissioner that year in a new york time oped he made an argument that did not differ much from those advocating the legalization of marijuana despite legal restriction sport betting is widespread he wrote because there are few legal option available those who wish to bet resort to illicit bookmaking operation and shady offshore website why not bring the action into the light he proposed where it could be regulated and the movement of betting line and the sum of money monitoredearlier that fall the nba signed a nineyear billion television right deal at the league board of governor meeting in new york leonsis who wa chairman of it medium committee presented it to the rest of the owner even a he celebrated the deal he cautioned that such fee were unlikely to grow though the cost of operating team inevitably would we have to find new pot of gold he saidleonsis believed he had found them on that trip to the united kingdom you can hold your nose all you want he later told his colleague but gambling offered a viable and wholly untapped source of revenue for the nba leonsis can be almost courtly in negotiation and he wa polite when he met resistance privately though he shook his head how could you ignore such an opportunity ready to be taken advantage of a soon a the law allowed what are you so afraid offor decade sport gambling tended to be a static experience you bet on a team and handed money to somebody and maybe got a slip of paper in return then you waited to find out if you were right that changed when three american option trader moved to antigua in the mids to create an online gambling business they named world sport exchange instead of offering point spread world sport exchange operated like a commodity market before tipoff option on the favored lakers for example might cost each option on the knicks the underdog might sell for at the end of the game the option on the losing team would become worthless while the option on the winning team would each pay out but here wa the novelty you didnt have to wait until the game wa over to cash in if the lakers scored the first eight point the value of that option might grow to say you could sell it and pocket your gain you might then invest in the knicks at a

until the game ended it wa exhausting it wa also great fun and even more than the other bookmaker operating beyond u border which were handling traditional bet it seemed to threaten the monopoly on

partner at world sport exchange later confided to me that he and ware were each making more than million a year yet they were miserable the interstate wire act of had outlawed taking bet over telephone line in that era of dialup internet access thats exactly what world sport exchange wa doing online gambling wa especially pernicious in the word of jon kyl the u senator from arizona you get up in the morning and log on to your computer and start to gamble it play to the addictive nature of many people especially kid quoting an unnamed harvard professor kyl called it the crack cocaine of gambling a conservative republican kyl introduced specific legislation against internet gambling and vowed to indict expat taking bet online in u citizen were charged with wire act violation among them were ware schillinger and jay cohen another partner weary of living in exile cohen flew home he wa convicted and served month in prison janet reno the u attorney general backed kyls effort so did casino sport league and gambling interest group just about everyone in fact except some indian tribe even the lobbyist being paid by world sport exchange acknowledged that the opponent of digital gambling had a point the casino worked a long time to establish legitimacy he told meeventually world sport exchange wa overtaken by betterfunded rival it ceased operation in that same day schillinger committed suicide after serving his sentence cohen disappeared to europe by then though their insight that betting doesnt have to stop when play begin had revolutionized the industry what draftkings and it competitor are currently doing in new jersey and what company like betfair and bet do in england could not exist without itsince the demise of world sport exchange sport betting on various handheld device ha proliferated and because smartphones and tablet routinely capture the detail of each transaction proponent argue that game are actually better protected against manipulation when digital betting is legal if there wa a huge bet placed against a team two hour before an announcement that it star player wouldnt be participating that is something that should cause u to investigate silver say and it something that historically we wouldnt have knownfor many nba owner and some in other league a well the conversion began in with silver oped and his argument that legalization actually offered more protection not le from the unsavory character who might try to influence player europe wa proving to be a test case and it team were thriving now leonsis ha come along telling owner that their franchise would gain in value because gambling like fantasy league give fan another reason to be engrossed in a sportted wa able to articulate the value proposition of not just the betting but the deepening of the engagement guber say rather than customer leonsis think of fan a an audience he understood that audience want experience guber say this give them a chance to walk away telling their own story i saw this opportunity i recognized what this player would be able to accomplish when you have a tool that make an audience more of a participant than a passenger it a very vital and vibrant elementthere are risk inherent in legalizing sport gambling guber belief but after talking with leonsis he became convinced that it opportunity far outweighed them the nba wa still a plaintiff when the supreme court heard the gambling case in late but by then guber wa among the many owner who were rooting for new jersey to winone afternoon last october terry link drove from his home outside chicago to springfield the illinois state capital an informational presentation about gambling wa scheduled in the house of representative the following day and link a democrat who serf a assistant majority leader in the illinois senate wanted to attend since he wa first elected in he ha sponsored several gambling bill not one became law im still waiting to get one signed he say ruefullybefore dinner that evening he stopped into a bar to meet jeremy kudon a lobbyist whom draftkings and it competitor fanduel have hired to help persuade legislator to pas law allowing digital gambling after ordering a soda link told kudon that illinois casino hoped to use sport betting to get new customer into their building he reminded kudon that casino have generated plenty of tax money for the state because of that link said he wouldnt favor a bill that would allow gambler to undermine them by placing bet from the couch in their living roomsthis wa a problem for kudon because bet placed from livingroom couch are exactly what his client need to survive kudon argued that gambler were already betting from their couch but doing so on illegal website and the state wa missing out on it cutdraftkings and fanduel whose valuation are both estimated to exceed billion were founded on the same idea curate a limitless number of fantasy league for profit generated by participation fee and let customer choose new player every day for many fan watching game quickly became the equivalent of monitoring their investment portfolio except the investment were bet on individual player eric schneiderman new york attorney general at the time thought that sounded a lot like gamblinggames of skill are legal in every state you can pay to participate in fishing or bowling competition for example and win cash prize what you cant do is bet on who you think will win those competition the fantasy site argued somewhat tenuously that constructing a winning team is more like fishing than knowing who is good at fishing schneiderman disagreed in he shut down both site and fined the company at that point draftkings and fanduel began working to get bill passed in state legislature that would certify fantasy sport a legalsoon after leonsis bought part of draftkings he tends to characterize troubled company in one of two way a either falling angel which eventually rise again or a falling knife which dont in draftkings he saw a falling angel he anticipated that digital sport betting would become legal and he agreed with jason robin the draftkings chief executive that the gamingindustry giant everyone assumed would dominate the u market the english bookmaker william hill or maybe ballys or caesar were actually at a disadvantage we have a big database of customer that we know from research are already betting on sport mostly with blackmarket website robin say and we have a brand that is much more identified with winning money and betting on sport than any of them that were competing withlast summer draftkings partnered with a casino a new jersey law requires and became the first company to begin taking digital bet since then it ha done more online business than any other bookmaker it ad blanket cable network in new jersey get ready for thousand of way to bet they shout and theyre not exaggerating one draftkings executive estimate that the company app average to different proposition for gambler to consider every daybut sport gambling law enacted in most other state have restricted digital activity mississippi allows it but only if the gambler are physically inside a casino delaware law ha not yet allowed any digital betting at all some casino plan to leverage their brand online but many regard digital gambling a a threat we have hundred of million of dollar invested in our casino say dan kehl the chief executive of elite casino resort whose family ha been in the gambling business in iowa since kehl back a bill that would require anyone who want to bet on sport to first register at one of iowa casino that wouldnt work in larger state he acknowledges but no one in iowa is more than an hour drive from a casino registered gambler could bet digitally though on only a limited selection of proposition the question is how far can we let the mobile go kehl say that trouble leonsis not just because draftkings might not get the right to operate profitably there but because nobody will if gambler betting on illegal site cant be persuaded to bet legally much of the windfall that investor and politician like terry link are anticipating wont materialize it not enough that state pas law legalizing sport betting leonsis explains they have to pas the right law the only way that gambling doesnt work he say is if the revenue projection are off if it turn out that all those estimate we hear are wildly inaccuratedespite kudons best effort law that leonsis considers favorable have been a difficult sell mostly because of political pressure from casino in springfield that evening link acknowledged that he personally favored digital site partnering with casino and paying them fee but he told kudon the illinois casino insist that whatever fee theyd get wouldnt make up for the loss of all those potential roulette player at that kudon rolled his eye the gambler that were talking about arent going to casino he said theyll never set foot in river a casino in de plaines ill because they can bet on sport on these illegal site so let encourage them to go on draftkings or fanduel instead and river will get a benefit to kudon the mathematics are clear the state get it licensing fee and now weve gotten rid of the black market he said that seems like a win to everyoneif link bill allowed handheld gambling a kudon fantasized traveler might even make bet while changing plane at ohare airport he urged link to consider what that would mean for illinois the million of tax dollar that might be generated if gambler didnt have to travel to a casino to bet link stroked his chin i dont think there a right answer yet link said you have to look at all the factor involved in new jersey nobody want to go to the boardwalk anymore all the casino there are going kaputhe sighed common ground seemed a long way away listen there no such thing a a perfect bill he said the reason we dont pas these bill come down to one word greed nobody want part of the pie they want the whole damn pielast july silver announced that the nba had in a sponsorship deal granted mgm resort the right to use league logo and data even the nhls bettman ha come to term with gambling weve had a very practical approach he told me in his office a few month later the previous afternoon the nhl announced it own deal with mgm though the payment involved wa said to be far smaller than the nbasbut gambling greatest impact at least proportionally could come in the new professional league it spawn and the moribund one it help to resurrect the arena football league once included team spread across the continent last year there were four leonsis owns the washington and baltimore franchise which make him not only the most powerful owner in the league but the only person preventing it demise he ha positioned it a an ideal entertainment vehicle for the next generation that includes gambling of course arena football average a touchdown every six play leonsis note a well a point a game lot of data generated he say and a multitude of possible betsgreater than billion ha been bet legally on football since according to the center for gaming research at the university of nevada la vega thats about percent more than on basketball and double the amount bet on baseball leonsis want to expand the afl to six franchise and eventually to but his vision mandate a network partner that will market the game a the antinfl informal expressive and gamblingfriendly it doesnt matter that the league a currently constituted ha almost no history he say your favorite team will be the one you have money on at the momenton a private flight to new york last fall leonsis ran through a pitch he planned to show sean mcmanus who run the sport department at cbs he envisioned fastpaced telecast of afl game on an affiliated sport channel but a the plane landed in teterboro nj he confided that he doesnt believe cbs will end up investing it executive are leery of jeopardizing their relationship with the nfl he said and thats probably wise the nfl most likely wouldnt look kindly on one of it primary partner televising another football league game a usual though leonsis wa looking further aheadif the nfl is smart they should want cbs to do this he said see how far they can take it let the afl be the canary in the coal mine see what work and what doesnt work and then they can pull back from there on their own telecast he paused cbs is going to be very nice to u today but i dont know if theyre ready for this were going to blow their mindsan hour later he wa still stuck in new jersey traffic he also hadnt stopped talking about gambling but while his idea had the potential to be wildly lucrative i wa struck by how little had actually happened in the month since the supreme court ruling the betting parlor in his arena remained theoretical draftkings wa thriving in new jersey but it hadnt yet been licensed in another state sportradars explosive growth still existed only in the imagination of it chief executive and most of the gambling law being considered in state legislature included severe limitation on digital play a a result in most state that have passed gambling law early revenue havent met projection the growth process is slow leonsis admitted and unpredictable yet he remained optimistic at aol it took u year to get to million user he said then it took u five year to get to millionjust then his car passed a billboard for a casino that read fire your bookie leonsis pulled out his phone look he said ill show you the draftkings app wa pulsing with offer there were odds on who would win that night nfl game and by how much but also bet on total point on various game odds on tennis match even european basketball i wa scrolling through them when we entered the holland tunnel and everything vanished we just passed into new york leonsis said so now it wont worka moment before id been a legal gambler now if i tried to place a bet from the same seat in the same car id be breaking the law i didnt say anything but leonsis must have read the incredulity in my expression he shruggedits a work in progress he saidbruce

bone health at riska disquieting new study of bone density in elite cyclist and runner suggests that the answer might be yes the study found that the cyclist both male and female had thinner bone than the runner even though all of the athlete were young healthy and enviably fit and many of the cyclist lifted weightsthe result underscore the divergent effect of various sport on our skeleton and also stir a little unease about the longterm impact of pursuing lowimpact exercise at the expense of more highimpact activitiesby and large the available scientific evidence show that physical activity is desirable and even necessary for bone health child who run hop and play develop thicker stronger bone than those who remain sedentary a do teenager and young adult who participate in sport involving sprinting and leapingmost scientist agree that these kind of activity build skeletal strength by generating sudden sharp force that minutely bow or deform the affected bone such activity jumpstart process within the body that increase the number of bone cell and help to prepare those part of the skeleton to withstand similar force in the futureeven middleaged and older people who once were thought to face inevitable thinning of their bone with age can maintain strong skeleton if they are sufficiently active recent study showbut which type of exercise bend bone in a desirable way and which are too gentle remains uncertain some past study suggest that running generates enough force to remodel bone while other experiment with runner conclude the opposite ditto with weight training and multiple study have raised concern about negligible or even adverse effect from non weightbearing exercise such a cycling and swimming which put little pressure on bonesin hope of gaining more clarity about sport and bone researcher at the norwegian school of sport science and the norwegian olympic training center in oslo decided to look closely at the skeleton of worldclass competitive cyclist and runnersthey focused on elite fulltime athlete in large part because the athlete heavy training could be expected to amplify any impact from and difference between the two sportsthey wound up recruiting highlevel runner and road cyclist men and woman most of them in their s and all of them lean fit and with several year of intense competition behind themthe athlete reported to a lab where scientist measured their body composition with particular focus on the density of their bone both over all and in their lower spine and the top of their femur portion of the skeleton that can indicate general bone healththe researcher also asked the athlete about their training health and calcium intake and whether they spent much time in the gym the latter question wa of particular interest to the researcher since weight training often is recommended to athlete in sport like cycling to bulk up their bone a well a their musclesthe scientist then compared data some of the difference between athlete were substantial if expected the cyclist trained far more than the runner for instance averaging about hour a year in the saddle versus about annual hour on the road or treadmill for the runnersthe cyclist also did more weight training with most of them heading to the gym during their offseason for intense lifting none of the runner did thatthe athlete in both sport consumed enough calcium to meet their expected daily requirementsbut they had noticeably different bonesthe cyclist a a group all had thinner bone than the runner and more than half of them met medical criterion for low bone mineral density in some portion of their skeleton one of the rider a man displayed clinical osteoporosis in his spinethese result are potentially worrisome say oddbjorn klomsten andersen a graduate student at the norwegian school of sport science and a former nationalteam cyclist himself who led the study which wa published in bmj open sport exercise medicinethere are limited study following young cyclist through their career he say but study in master cyclist demonstrate that a larger proportion of them have low bone mineral density or osteoporosis than people who do not cyclethis study can not tell u though why cyclist bone might be thin he add they could have been eating too little or sweating too much for ideal bone health both low calorie intake and high rate of calcium loss through sweating have been tied to bone loss in other studiesmore surprising the cyclist heavy weight training seems not to have built much bonebut a mr andersen point out this wa a onetime snapshot of the athlete health it possible he say that weight training prevented even greater bone thinningit is also encouraging he say that the runner harbored relatively healthy bone since some past study have hinted that running might not stimulate bone buildingover all the study finding suggest that serious cyclist might want to consider at least sometimes branching out mr andersen saysi would generally recommend combining cycling with weightbearing exercise to promote good bone health he saysadvertisement

announced a million project to double the sensitivity of the antenna for the laser interferometer gravitationalwave observatory or ligo which stunned the world three year ago by detecting spacetime ripple from colliding black holesonly the day before nasa had announced the selection of it newest astronomy mission a satellite that will map the entire sky including million of galaxy star and planet in three dimension and color the twoyear mission called spherex short for hold on the spectrophotometer for the history of the universe epoch of reionization and ice explorer will look for clue to the asyetunknown force that propelled the big bangneither announcement would be big news by itself new project are springing up all the time the same week nasa also announced the formation of a crossdisciplinary research network the prebiotic chemistry and early earth environment consortium to help guide future search for life on other world and last year with serious fanfare congress passed and president trump signed the national quantum initiative designed to provide more money and organization into harnessing the most arcane science of quantum mechanic for computing and cryptographysign up to get reminder for space and astronomy event on your calendarthe upgraded ligo advanced ligo plus wont kick in until or so although classic advanced ligo will be back online sometime this spring on the prowl for whatever is out there and nasa spherex wont be launched until or laterbut the close timing of the announcement is a reminder of an aspect of science that get scant attention especially at nobel prize time we applaud a few heroic einstein for their moment of inspiration and discovery but much of the real action in science occurs on the sideline often year before any wizardry in the lab some of is performed by army of people whose name are mostly unknown others are wellknown politician like president john f kennedy declaring the moon shot in throwing their weight on the lever of historyfor many baseball fan the most exciting part of the game is the socalled hot stove league now in progress here the hero are crafty general manager who wheel and deal barter and sign and deploy their player like so many chess piece there wa branch rickey who integrated major league baseball by signing jackie robinson and putting him on first base for the dodger in but only after provoking him to make sure he would be strong enough to take the expected abuse without striking back recently theo epstein ha become a front office legend by rebuilding the

freeagent superstarso too in the hot stove science leaguefuture nobel prize are won in congressionalcommittee hearing room and on august panel at the national academy of science by budgetwielding bureaucrat without their effort there would be no lab or research grant this is a point made emphatically by the wellknown author michael lewis the blind side liar poker moneyball in his latest book the fifth risk which tell story of civil servant in bureaucracy like the department of energy commerce and agriculture working to keep the country nuclear arsenal and fleet of weather satellite in shape and their travail under the trump administrationthis summer the world will pay tribute to the apollo lunar landing year ago and to the bravery and skill of astronaut such a neil armstrong buzz aldrin and michael collins but the man who did a much a anyone to put them up there wa james webb nasa administrator from to never miss an eclipse a meteor shower a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event thats out of this worldafter a capsule fire killed three astronaut in webb took charge of the investigation setting a standard for the space agency wartsandall frankness and gave the goahead for apollo s dramatic moon mission during christmas in he stepped down in october just before richard nixon election but at least he will have a telescope named for him the longdelayed james webb space telescope when it finally launch maybe in political economic bureaucratic geographic and historic machination now at work will determine where the next giant telescope or next big particle collider will be built laptoptoting physicist have been crisscrossing the ocean between japan china and europe for the last decade trying to cajole colleague and their government into pouring many billion of dollar into the future of physic by the time particle start zinging around any such machine many of these scientist will have retiredas frederick bordry cerns director of accelerator said last year im working for the young peoplefew people had ever heard of ligo before february of when it astronomer announced that they had heard black hole dancing in the dark the discovery knocked the world on it head confirming for the first time the existence of gravitational wave and of those dead pit of spacetime black hole it also garnered a nobel prize for it originator and leader rainer wei of mit and kip thorne and barry barish of the california institute of technologyof course by then ligo had been in the work for year and had already cost the national science foundation a billion dollar it success wa a saga of persistence ingenuity and just plain bravery in the face of nature and professional skepticism the twin antenna at hanford wash and livingston la are basically lshaped tube of vacuum empty space inside them laser beam monitor the distance between two mirror mile apart looking for a gravitational wave that will squeeze that distance by le than the diameter of a protonconvincing anybody that this scheme would work wa no small or quick task the ligo team owes it nobel prize partly to skeptical physicist and astronomer who didnt like that a physic experiment wa being called an observatory who fought the project tooth and nail holding it proponent foot to the fire in study and workshop over and over making them prove that it would work on

by daniel duane feb these woman want the right to compete in bigwave contest and get paid a much a men do these woman want the right to compete in bigwave contest and get paid a much a men doby daniel duane photograph by dina litovsky feb one sunny morning in january on a white boat in the blue sea off the hawaiian island maui bianca valenti and keala kennelly sat on a beanbag listening to german sparkle party a song by the something experience and waiting for the right moment to surf foot wave valenti who is and a muscular foot with a small square jaw and friendly brown eye life in san francisco and is the best female bigwave surfer on the united state mainland kennelly and a slight foot with spiky peroxided hair life on oahu in hawaii and is the best female bigwave surfer on earththe wave that day at a surf spot called peahi or more commonly known a jaw were the biggest in recent memory they were too big really with plenty in the ideal range of to foot on the face but others in the borderlineimpossible range of to a strong wind wa also creating bump on the ocean surface like boulder on a bad dirt road kennelly had already ridden a footer that day paddling her surfboard to catch a wave at it tallest point hopping to her foot and soaring down the enormous blue face then turning hard onto the unbroken wall and riding fast in front of the curl until the wave petered out it wasnt the kind of ride that attracts endorsement deal or win the bigwave equivalent of an oscar at the annual world surf league big wave award the wave did not qualify a mindblowingly huge and kennelly did not get barreled aka tubed the ne plus ultra of the sport by riding inside the whirling cylinder created when the lip of the wave curl over and form a tunnel before collapsing but that day kennelly wa trying to avoid hospitalization by restraining her native impulse toward extreme risktakingvalenti wa le comfortable at jaw she had surfed smaller wave there many time but wave of this size only a few and on this particular afternoon she had yet to get in the water jaw is one of the world two most important bigwave break the other is maverick a halfhour south of san francisco which valenti surf regularly valenti knew that getting barreled at jaw would be a careerdefining moment for her and she openly confessed that it wa her life dream back home she jump off meter diving platform to overcome fear of long fall and practice the breathing technique of an eccentric dutch athlete and endurance guru wim hof who is known a the iceman in hope of better surviving long underwater holddowns after wipeout when turbulent water prevents a surfer from rising to get air valenti also follows the guidance of a stanford neuroscientist and her personal sport psychologist to conjure spirit animal appropriate to specific surf condition killer bee spider monkey and that day at jaw a character she called malolo bull kitty a cross between a flying fish a bull and well a kittyvalenti took in the scene other boat crowded with photographer men on jet ski racing in and out of the danger zone to rescue surfer after wipeout and among the wave plus men from what might be called the international bigwave jet set an almost exclusively male community of pro from europe africa australia hawaii and california valenti watched these men do what contemporary bigwave pro must to succeed deliberately ride the most dangerous and violent portion of the day biggest wave displaying astonishing skill and bravery but also losing control and cartwheeling down heaving blue mountainside shattering surfboard and being pushed to the bottom of the sea and requiring rescueit wa already afternoon when valenti decided she had to get in the water she felt a burden to prove that female bigwave surfer can keep up with men more so because she helped found in the committee for equity in woman surfing an activist group that started with the modest ambition of getting woman invited to bigwave contest from which they had always been excluded and grew unexpectedly into a reckoning for the global sport of competitive surfingvalenti changed into the standard bigwave outfit a shortsleeve wet suit a black neoprene vest bulky with buoyant padding and a second vest bristling with pull tab the tab were connected to cartridge of compressed gas that could if necessary fill air bladder and float a surfer up from the deep she dropped her foot pink surfboard into the water splashed down after it and paddled off to join the men nauseated with excitement and trying to maintain what she call the patience of a zen buddhist monk valenti spent the next two hour paddling up and over gigantic wave waiting for one that she felt confident trying to ridea man on a jet ski told valenti that her boat captain wanted to leave valenti reminded herself that she felt great and strong and ready then a wave appeared out at sea imagine standing on a sidewalk in front of a twostory house now picture a threestory house next door stack the first house on top of the second and extend this fivestory colossus yard to the right and left a translucent aquamarine cliff speeding toward you if valenti froze in fear and did nothing the cobalt wave face would suck concave into a gaping mouth with an upper lip flying forward to land on her with the impact of a commercial fishing vessel dropped out of the skyvalenti paddled toward the wave to maintain the option of paddling up and over before it broke then she made a snap transition to what she call one million percent focus valenti sat bolt upright weighted the tail of her board and rotated degree toward shore paddling furiously now beastmodeing sprinting she say valenti felt herself being pulled backward up the wave face prone and still paddling she wa lifted to the height of a secondstory window then a thirdstory window then a fourth she hopped to standing a the wave face steepened past vertical and her mind went silent valenti and her board fell foot through the air she landed partway down the wave accelerated off a bump on the surface and airdropped another foot until she landed at the wave base astonished to find herself upright she lost balance tumbling into the water valenti wa violently pulled skyward into airborne flipping cartwheel she yanked a tab to inflate her vest and crossed her arm to grab her own shoulder because she say the most common injury is to have your arm ripped out of your socket she hit the water a second time and wa drawn right back up and over that wave curling apex and down again through foot of air and foot of thrashing water her vest brought her to the surface just in time to be buried by a second huge wavea jet ski driver found valenti bobbing dazed among raft of white sea foam back at the boat she climbed aboard exhausted but full of the feeling she always get from the instant she take off on a big one peacefulness again a she put it from anxiety to this feeling of this is where im meant to bebigwave surfing originated in hawaii in the s and by the late s it wa synonymous with a break called waimea bay on oahu north shore and also with courageous masculinity there were exception a yearold girl named linda benson rode a wave with an estimated foot face at waimea in and margo oberg widely recognized a the first female professional surfer also rode big surf at nearby sunset beach in the s still the sport wa dominated by outsize male personality like buzzy trent author of an infamous article titled big wave are masculine woman feminine in the november issue of surf guide magazine there nothing more beautiful than a wellshaped girl riding a sixfoot wave with the wind blowing through her hair trent wrote but one thing i cant stand is girl riding or attempting to ride big waveswhen it came to the question of how big a wave it wa possible for anyone to surf the consensus during the next couple of decade held that it wa physiologically impossible to paddle a surfboard fast enough to catch and ride a wave bigger than foot on the face all waveheight estimate are just that estimate the traditional hawaiian wavemeasurement scale which is still sometimes used would report surf size based on half of the height of the wave face such that surf foot tall on the face would instead be reported a foot hawaiian surfer rode conservatively to avoid the dangerous underwater holddowns and long swim that followed wipeout judge who scored contestant at early bigwave contest like the prestigious eddie aikau invitational first held at waimea in which honored a local surfer and lifeguard who died trying to save others after a sailing accident encouraged that approach with criterion that rewarded successful completion of ride meaning surfer scored higher if they avoided falling and rode a wave until it fadedthe wave rider of dakarthat all began to change in when a california carpenter named jeff clark invited a few male surfer to join him at a secret spot that he had been surfing alone for year known a maverick and hidden in plain sight off a rocky headland on the northern california coast that break acquired an ominous reputation in when a waimea specialist named mark foo fell on a footer there and drowned four year later a maverick became recognized a far superior to waimea clark handpicked male athlete and raised a prize purse from the quiksilver clothing company for a new bigwave contest called men who ride mountainsnot a single woman wa known to have surfed maverick until when sarah gerhardt a chemistry doctoral student at the time gave it a try gerhardt recall being harassed by male surfer in the parking lot at bigwave break microaggressions like get the hell out of here she say at maverick once gerhardt paddled away from shore she found the men who were actually in the water astonished to see a female face and welcoming a if anyone willing to confront such risk deserved respect clark added gerhardt to the bottom of his list of alternate competitor for the men who ride mountain contest for a few year but gerhardt wa uninterested in competition and considered herself le skilled than the top men she say so it did not bother her that she wa never actually invited to surf in the contestduring the s the elite windsurfer and surfer laird hamilton popularized the use of jet ski for towing a standing surfer into gigantic wave at jaw that motorized assist allowed hamilton to reach higher initial velocity than by paddling and thereby to ride and footer surfer everywhere invested in jet ski and the future of the sport appeared forever mechanizedthen in a brazilian surfer named danilo couto outdid hamilton by forgoing the jet ski and paddling into a wave with a tofoot face at jaw shattering the bigwave equivalent of the fourminute mile the next month when a surfer named shane dorian got barreled on a huge jaw wave paddlein surfing reclaimed the spotlight but with a move toward inflatable vest and jet ski rescue so that surfer could experiment with everbigger wave gopro camera and social medium also began driving the same increasingly dangerous behavior that they encourage in every extreme sport judging criterion for bigwave contest and award changed accordingly away from the old conservative ethic and toward a greater emphasis on commitment deliberately seeking the most dangerous path across the tallest part of every wavebig wave are rare there are only about a dozen place on earth known to get wave over about foot on the face with the right shape for surfing and those break rarely have ideal condition more than a few time a year contest organizer receive permit that allow them to hold only a single one or twoday event at some unspecified time over a severalmonth season then watch weather chart for a wind and swell forecast that merit telling their handpicked invitee all over the world to jump on plane usually with hour notice year pas when those condition never materialize the scarcity and unpredictability of big wave keep participation low and the sport remains overwhelmingly male with perhaps men and two dozen woman total worldwidemost bigwave contest over the year have been grassroots affair organized by local who tended to invite their male friend from other bigwave break the world surf league a california company that run almost all surfing contest hold more formal bigwave contest in nazaré portugal and at jaw but the league excludes woman from the portugal contest and included woman at jaw for the first time only in with a total purse that wa half the prize for men over the past two year though valenti and kennelly along with two other surfer andrea moller and paige alms have insisted upon the same right to risk their life in competition that men enjoy and for equal pay and they have been more successful than they ever imaginedlike most female surfer of her generation valenti grew up unaware that woman even rode big wave she learned to surf at age in dana point calif in orange county in third grade she wrote an essay about her dream of becoming a professional and surfing the powerful banzai pipeline on the north shore of oahu valenti excelled in youth contest and like many girl surfer idolized kennelly a top pro at the time equaling the best men at display of fearless aggression and technical mastery in dangerous surf when valenti wa in her early teen she signed modest endorsement deal with surfwear company she subscribed to every surf magazine but found them boring because they featured action shot of only boy and men with girl strictly on the beach in bikini valentis frustration deepened when she became convinced that her sponsor paid more to girl who looked like model even if valenti outsurfed them when she protested she lost her endorsement contractsvalenti wa captain of the surf team at uc santa barbara and after graduation took another shot at going pro in she entered a qualifying event for the woman championship tour a competition of seven contest in hawaii at the break she dreamed about a a little girl the banzai pipeline the wave were unusually big during valentis contest but she rode barrel after barrel and won beating even kennelly valenti could not afford to travel to more qualifying contest so she tried to line up new endorsement deal without luck i took a step back and i wa like well i love getting barreled and i love the feeling of big wave so im just going to focus on that she saidthere wa not a single woman bigwave contest at the time much le a woman bigwave tour by then valenti wa working at her father restaurant in mill valley a suburb of san francisco and surfing maverick for fun in march she wa invited to the firstever woman bigwave contest part of a larger men event in oregon at a remote offshore break called nelscott reef although there wa no announced prize purse for woman and only six female contestant valenti made the hour drive north when she arrived she got to know kennelly moller and alms who had bonded while traveling to oregon from hawaiikennelly grew up in a small town on kauai where her father and brother were surfer and hamilton a family friend wa her godfather kennelly childhood friend included andy iron a threetime world champion and she absorbed the local veneration for charging fiercely attacking the most frightening wave kennelly joined the woman championship tour at age and wa almost unbeatable in contest at powerful break like teahupoo pronounced chopoo in tahiti where south pacific groundswell hit shallow coral with even more violence than at the banzai pipeline and where a young tahitian man died in after he broke his back and neckkennelly like a hybrid of fighter pilot and toreador excelled at threading a safe path through teahupoos terrifying barrel that feat requires so many instantaneous adjustment to surfboard and body angle that the conscious mind must remove itself from the decision loop and allow sensory data to find direct pathway from intuition to reflex inducing what diane ackerman in her book deep play describes a a core pursuit of extreme sport and shamanic practice the rapture and ecstasy that come when consciousness vanishes like the gorgeous fever it is and you feel free of all mindbody constraintskennelly ranked in the top on the woman championship tour from to and came close to becoming overall world champion in she attracted lucrative sponsorship but she grew frustrated with the association of surfing professional which became the world surf league in for it practice of paying woman le than men at every contest worldwide kennelly also suffered from the industry hypersexualization of female pro including pressure to present herself a heterosexual she identifies a a lesbian and sexual harassment by surfwearcompany employee who managed sponsored athlete creepy team manager she call them trying to creep on you and im like not into itin the association of surfing professional stopped holding woman contest at teahupoo citing safety concern while continuing to let men compete there kennelly wa furious without the extra tour point that she typically earned at teahupoo she saw no path to becoming world champion and in left the tour male pro particularly those specializing in big wave made a living outside the championship tour a socalled free surfer earning their keep with sponsor by appearing in photo and video of intimidating surf kennelly gave that a try and also stopped hiding the fact that she wa gay the first professional surfer to do so three of kennelly four sponsor abandoned her the economy wa tanking at the time but kennelly assumed coming out didnt helpits like you dont have to have sex with me to keep your job but you have to make me want to have sex with you she say recalling the message she received a a sponsored female surfer and it fun seeing you in a bikini but it not fun seeing you charge giant wave in kennelly wa in tahiti when a gigantic swell forced official to declare a code red emergency banning boat from the water and delaying a men contest kennelly joined a small cohort of surfer who set out on jet ski anyway to experience teahupoo a a proper bigwave break with barrel the size of the holland tunnel if the holland tunnel morphed and whirled like the vortex eye of a crystallineblue tornado that happened to be spinning within a few foot of hard razorsharp coral kennelly surfed flawlessly she described experience like that during a ted talk time slows down some of your sens like smell taste and sound fade away while others are so incredibly heightened you feel like you have superhuman power your sight ha pinpoint precision focus and your sense of touch is so amplified you can feel every drop of water on that wavetwo day later when the wave got much smaller kennelly fell into the reef head first rushed to a hospital she underwent emergency facialreconstruction surgery the following morning discharged onto a tahiti street with a bandaged head kennelly realized that nobody wa coming to meet her rep from her one remaining sponsor were in town she say hosting male pro at a luxury hotel the sale rep just fanboy out on those guy and get them whatever they want and i dont do anything for them kennelly told me all watching me surf doe for them is make their ball shrinkandrea moller is one of the most decorated water athlete in hawaiian history with dozen of record and race victory in windsurfing outriggercanoeing and standup paddleboarding in addition to bigwave surfing she grew up on a brazilian island where her father owned a marina and taught her to windsurf in moller moved to maui for college and took up surfing when she gave birth to a girl five year later she named her keala after kennelly whose career moller followedjaws wa near mollers home on maui so when hamilton and other men began towsurfing there moller asked some of them to take her along they were rarely willing in moller and maria souza hamilton exwife who also had a small child pooled money to buy a used jet ski they taught themselves field repair like changing spark plug then motored out to jaw they found men convinced that woman did not belong there they were like it too dangerous moller recall youre going to die what are you doing here it wa a very big barrier but i wanted to have the fun they were havingmoller soon towed into a plusfooter bigger than anything ever ridden by all but a handful of men standing on her surfboard at the top of that wave she say looking down over the immense ramp of water below you know you have a long way to travel to make it out of the danger zone so it almost a moment of silence because it just you and this huge volume of water and this patpatpat of your board on the surface once she made the drop and turned up into the wave wall moller say youre in this silent glass world of water and youre in so much risk and yet youre so driven that it almost feel like there a pause she recall the wave growing bigger a she rode along until it blocked out the rising sun and seemed a if it might keep growing forever that vision never left her thats the wave of your life she say the wave that year later you can still can go back toin moller returned to school to become a paramedic but she continued chasing big surf eventually after couto had broken the foot paddlein barrier at jaw moller went out and started paddling into the spot big wave in a wave hit moller so hard that it ripped her hamstring muscle off the bone unable to walk for month she depended on her yearold daughter for help bathing still moller recovered and didnt stop surfing big wave i think it defines me who i am she say like when i got hurt i wondered could i just settle down and make

recall running to a local surf shop whenever kennelly wa there signing autograph a maui surfboard shaper mentored alms from the age of to and pushed her into foot wave alms male peer took it for granted that she would join them at jaw she first towsurfed there at and she started paddlesurfing around the same time moller didthe contest in at nelscott reef in oregon wa the first time that alms moller kennelly and valenti surfed together that morning they pulled on thick wet suit under frigid blue sky jet ski carried them out to the reef where foot surf broke in long even wall all four woman were thrilled by the experience of riding big surf without men kennelly in particular found the abundance of available giant wave almost dangerously liberating a she put it im like i can take any of these when you have just a couple other chick and youre used to hungry guy it so hard not to overstoke itthey were together again in maui last january the day after valenti and kennelly surfed at jaw alms hadnt joined them in the water because she didnt like the condition and moller sat out with a knee injury sustained while practicing brazilian jujitsu the four woman drank coffee on comfortable couch in the cluttered living room of the house that alms who repaired surfboard and worked at a fish restaurant shared with her boyfriend on the green slope of maui biggest volcano haleakala one wall of that room held a framed photograph of alms proudest moment a a surfer when she became in the first and still only woman to get barreled at jaw it wa set above the actual surfboard she rode a surfer equivalent of a mounted rhino head and the rifle that fired the fatal bulletmuch of their talk wa about male pro who make enough to buy lastminute intercontinental plane ticket many time a year to bigwave break then charter boat with catered lunch and pay still other men with jet ski to pull them out of danger after wipeout valenti heard a south african pro mention that a spreadsheet help him keep track of all the surfboard and safety vest he ha stashed in storage locker around the world thats how ill know when ive succeeded valenti said when ive got my own spreadsheetall that practice and travel plus all those bigwave contest open only to men help men improve and also accumulate the currency of bigwave success photo and video that please sponsor win award and earn invitation to more contest kennelly at the peak of her power wa making end meet by working full time a a bartender and disc jockey known a djkk every woman in alms living room dreamed of having the financial freedom to surf big wave full timeone morning last winter at the pastel rowhouse that valenti share near the beach in san francisco she sat on a chair in her garage among wall rack cluttered with surfboard valenti told me that she became an activist at the urging of a filmmaker named dayla soul who wa making a documentary about female bigwave surfer in the bay area after shooting video of the oregon contest soul told valenti that woman deserved the right to compete at maverick too soul then tipped off valenti that a callin radio show planned to interview jeff clark the man who first organized the contest at maverick along with griffin guess founder of the company cartel management which wa promoting the eventon june valenti listened a the radio host asked clark about female surfer like all bigwave contest the one at maverick wa strictly invitational because the contest could last only one day it accommodated only athlete they were chosen by a small committee of men that included clark on the radio guess explained that for woman to qualify they would have to rank in the top and compete with men an approach to athletic competition that is virtually unheardof including in all other surfing contest clark added that he wa open to an expression session a le prestigious exhibition if enough woman surfed maverick on noncontest day to prove their abilitiesvalenti knew clark had seen her surf maverick and that he had seen footage of the woman event in oregon so she called in to the show and asked what else it would take for cartel to invite them it on you now clark replied you need to get that group of woman to come and surf clark say now that he wa thinking mostly about safety a second male hawaiian surfer sion milosky drowned at maverick in at the time of valentis call many men were also arguing about whether big wave were too dangerous for woman after a incident in portugal a male surfer named carlos burle towed a female surfer named maya gabeira into an footer there one of the largest wave ever caught at the time gabeiras board hit a bump and she wiped out she wa driven underwater and buried in the wave burle found her floating face down unresponsive and not breathing her ankle broken he revived her with cprcnn sought comment from hamilton about gabeira she should not be in this kind of surf hamilton said it carlos responsibility to take care of her and he just lucky that she didnt drown chas smith a founder of the popular online surf tabloid beachgrit told me that other male bigwave surfer complained about woman at the time they said these woman are danger to themselves and to u because they drown and then we drown trying to save them to prove that woman could handle themselves just fine a female tech entrepreneur named nico sell wanted to finance a woman contest at maverick when she discovered that clark had an exclusive contest permit she invited more than a dozen woman including kennelly moller and alms to travel there and surf together in december on a noncontest day it wa the largestever gathering of woman in big wavesstill when cartel sought permit for it next contest it made no provision for woman any contest at maverick must have permit from numerous government agency most are rubberstamp affair and cartel wa finalizing a fiveyear exclusive permit from the san mateo county harbor districtin november clark attended a meeting of the california coastal commission seeking a permit from that agency too during the public comment period at the meeting a woman named sabrina brennan stood up to speak brennans wife wa a surfer and brennan also happened to be a commissioner with the san mateo county harbor district frustrated with her own agency for granting cartel an exclusive permit brennan told the coastal commission that if it wa going to grant cartel exclusivity it should also require the company to invite woman she gave a powerpoint presentation explaining that the nature of these permit combined with cartel failure to invite woman effectively barred female surfer from competing at maverick clark insisted that woman were excluded only because they did not surf well enough or a he put it they did not start their ride at maverick in what he called the bowl the biggest and most dangerous part of the wave valenti point out that foo and milosky each died taking off on the bowl other men have had eardrum blown out and plenty of top men avoid it the coastal commission granted cartel an exclusive oneyear permit but made renewal dependent upon a comprehensive plan for including woman in the futureone day several month after the meeting valenti wa standing outside a surf shop clark owns when clark sped up in his truck hit the brake and jumped out he wa livid valenti say eye bulging out coming straight at me he went into like a minute screamfest clark told me that he wa upset because valenti once said in huge surf at maverick that she did not feel ready for the wave that day and then she went on the radio claiming that she wa ready valenti say she doesnt remember ever saying thisvalenti felt hostility from other local male surfer too perhaps because they resented her demand for inclusion in a contest that excluded them merely surfing a break like maverick ha the power to transform a person into a bigwave surfer an exalted status that money cant buy an invitation to a contest brings still greater respect with room for only surfer in a contest that took place once a year at most inviting woman inevitably meant inviting fewer men demanding that cartel invite woman also threatened the control that clark held over an immensely valuable social commoditygabeiras towpartner burle saw something else at work growing up poor in brazil and told all his life that he wa foolish to dream of pro surfing he identified with woman who resisted effort to define what they could and could not achieve the persistence of those male effort in burles view had to do with bigwave surfing role a a proving ground where men strive to establish manhood if youre proving yourself stronger than other men and then come a woman and start to do whatever youre doing burle told me maybe thats diminishing your achievementread about gabeiras recordsetting return to nazarédayla soul watched the live webcast of the november coastal commission meeting and wa thrilled by brennans presentation two day later soul met brennan in california soul who is transgender and brennan each had decade of experience in lgbt political activism soul introduced valenti to brennan who encouraged her to organize an advocacy group valenti then reached out to kennelly moller and alms while brennan enlisted yet another ally karen tynan a labor lawyer who offered to help pro bono in february tynan joined valenti brennan and others in a visit to the coastal commission office in san francisco where tynan pointed out that the california coastal act of forbids discrimination in all use of public resource commission staff member were sympathetic and encouraged valenti to make their case for a nondiscriminatory maverick contestbrennan with the help of valenti and the other surfer worked out contest detail during the spring and summer of in september the six woman formed the committee for equity in woman surfing cartel meanwhile submitted a written application for a fouryear extension of it exclusive permit from the coastal commission the company also posted a list on instagram that same month of prospective invitee for including four woman alms moller gabeira and emily erickson the daughter of roger erickson a famous bigwave surfer in the s but neither kennelly nor valenti nine day later cartel posted a shorter list with every woman name gonein november the coastal commission held it permitting meeting at the oceano hotel at pillar harbor next to maverick optimism electrified the room a it filled with female surfer from around california who had come to support the woman bigwave cause by that point cartel had amended it permit application to include a woman heat at maverick albeit with only six athlete and a prize purse far smaller than that for men brennan stepped to the lectern and listed the main demand of the committee for equity in woman surfing at least female athlete and six alternate invited to compete one woman on the athleteselection committee chosen by female surfer and the same cash prize for the men and the womena parade of woman followed brennan to the microphone jennifer savage california policy manager for the surfrider foundation a nonprofit that advocate conservation of the coastal and marine environment said that teaching her child to surf had been a highlight of her life a a mother savage urged commissioner to recognize the culturechanging power of woman in giant surf my younger daughter ha continued to push herself into bigger and bigger wave in santa cruz and my son take for granted that woman can charge because he learned to surf in the shadow of his sister she saidthe next woman to the lectern wa delia bensekang who had driven seven hour from near the oregon border to speak a she put it on behalf of the neighboring surf community of humboldt county and a part of the greater woman surf movement bensekang said that she grew up where the wave are big the water is cold and we wear wet suit instead of bikini a a young girl learning to surf big wave in cold water bensekang struggled to find female pro surfer to idolize today that ha changed she said there is now a tribe of woman bigwave surfer who have dedicated their life to surfing big wave and want to showcase their talent she continued we need to show this next generation of girl and boy that all of u are equal and have equal opportunitiesmira manickamshirley the cofounder of a community organization called brown girl surf which is based in oakland and dedicated to connecting girl and woman of color to the ocean and surfing addressed the audience bianca valenti is literally their hero she said of the girl in her programthe coastal commission voted to approve only a oneyear extension with renewal again contingent on still greater inclusion of woman commissioner martha mcclure evoked mount everest woman were once told they did not belong there either then cartel finalized it list of six female invitee alms moller kennelly gerhardt erickson and jamilah star a veteran bigwave surfer living in hawaii valenti the only active female maverick regular and the winner of the only woman bigwave contest in the previous five year wa iced out she kept her composure until she wa alone in her car driving home then she began to weep when i told clark recently that valenti felt a if somebody wa sending her a message he replied she wa not crazy to read meaning in thatthe world surf league a californiabased company that run more than contest around the world justified paying female athlete le than men by using a pay parity formula for calculating contest prize purse that add the same fixed amount to the pot for every athlete male or female but the league invited far fewer woman than men to nearly all contest so purse and therefore prize remained grossly unequal nonetheless the world surf league ha taken some step toward greater equity in recent year like increasing the overall number of woman contest in november it held the firstever woman division in the bigwave contest at jaw though with a far smaller firstplace prize than for men that day high wind made for such dangerous condition that kennelly and erickson each had knee torn apart in fall valenti caught a big one and wa blown straight upward by the wind right into the lip for a punishing wipeout the inertia a popular adventuresports website ran an opinion piece by a male surf journalist named jp currie who called the contest an abject failure and wrote i dont see woman achieving equality i see woman striving for masculinitystill alms displayed a perfect balance of caution and aggression by catching a footer before it became too steep hopping into a stable crouch she drew a clean line down the face and turned hard onto that big wall flying along with controlled confidence until the wave faded alms did the same on a footer to win the contest and suddenly the world surf league wa in the business of crowning a woman bigwave world championtwo month later cartel management which had been struggling financially filed for bankruptcy the world surf league bought cartel maverick harbordistrict permit for and sought a singleseason permit from the coastal commission with the same offer that cartel had made six athlete and a smaller prize purse the commission agreed to only a oneyear nonexclusive permit yet again demanding greater inclusion of woman in the future weather condition never allowed for a maverick contest during the season but the world surf league second woman contest at jaw in october wa a success valenti alms kennelly and moller all rode tofooters and alms won again but the surf medium largely ignored the event a if success were le interesting than failure last summer valenti won the first woman bigwave event in latin america at puerto escondido in mexico and received the male winner received in july the committee for equity in woman surfing effectively declared war against the world surf league sending a letter to the coastal commission arguing that the league wa in violation of state civil right law not just at maverick but a a californiabased company in all operation worldwide the league denies that it ha done anything illegal later that month sophie goldschmidt chief executive of the world surf league met with brennan tynan valenti and others at a hotel near the san francisco airport brennan focused on maverick demanding the inclusion of female athlete with equal pay and noting that this would cost the world surf league le than in a contest for which it had spent half a million for one permitaccording to brennan tynan and valenti goldschmidt accused them of exploiting the metoo movement and used the word poor performance to describe woman bigwave surfing they also recall goldschmidts declaring equal pay out of the question threatening to cancel maverick and saying that if the world surf league paid equally there the league would have to pay equally everywhere when i asked goldschmidt over the phone about this meeting she said it wa private and that it would be inappropriate to comment later the world surf league on her behalf denied that she made comment about poor performance and metoovalenti left the meeting despondent brennan contacted elliott almond a reporter with the bay area news group and told him that the world surf league wa resisting pressure to pay woman equally at maverick brennan provided almond with an email from the world surf league threatening to cut off communication with the committee for equity in woman surfing over over what the league called false claim made to permitting agency about our history and compliance with law almond article published in the san jose mercury news on aug caught the attention of jennifer lucchesi an executive director of the california state land commission an agency that control the narrow strip of coast between the median high and lowtide line and also requires permit to hold surf contest lucchesi who is a competitive openwater swimmer told brennan by phone that the land commission had three commissioner including state controller betty yee who brennan knew had a history of fighting for pay equity also on the committee wa gavin newsom then lieutenant governor and running for governor whom brennan believed she could get on board lucchesis staff wa already processing an application from the world surf league to lease acre of tideland at maverick for the contest and lucchesi and her staff eventually asked brennan to suggest termsby coincidence on aug gov jerry brown signed a bill that made surfing the official sport of california a lot of people thought it wa comedic and a joke yee told me but it got me thinking how do we elevate the state sport to make it truly representative of california the answer came when lucchesi posted to the land commission website a staff report that characterized the inclusion of and equal pay for woman at maverick a central to the larger project of promoting fair treatment of people of all race culture national origin gender gender identity gender expression religion sexual orientation and socioeconomic status the report thesis read like the motto of a newly independent republic of california the wave do not discriminatein every way newsom told me via email in november after beating the republican candidate john cox to become governor of california this decision aligned with the value that california stand to defend at a time when gender equity is being attacked nationwidethe world surf league in negotiation with the land commission staff asked if it would be acceptable if there were a little more money for that year contest in exchange for equality at some point in the future the committee for equity in woman surfing didnt want that unequal wa unequal day passed valenti pleaded with other surfer for public statement of support male competitor were coming at u valenti recall like you girl are pushing too hard you should be thankful just to be invited and just shut up online commenters on surfing website seethedgreedy b from the woman nothing short of dangerous for any and all sport paige alms keala kennelly andrea moller and bianca valenti should be ashamedawful hegelian feminism strike surfing nownext come affirmative action to make sure there is an appropriate number of minoritieson sept valenti read an email from a professional surf photographer accusing the committee of jeopardizing the very survival of bigwave competition and imploring it to stop valenti wa so depressed that she lay down for a nap she awoke to a series of unexpected text message goldschmidt had announced that the world surf league would become the first global united statesbased sport league ever to offer equal prize money for men and woman across all event in all discipline worldwidefilmy cloud blanketed the sky pale gray on oct when valenti joined kennelly moller brennan and tynan on the beach at maverick for the opening ceremony of what they hoped would be the first woman contest there not the contest itself just the beginning of the fivemonth waiting period which run through march gerhardt drove up from nearby santa cruz and other female competitor traveled to the break with a dozen or so male invitee including jeff clark himself the surfer all paddled out on surfboard to form a floating circle holding hand for prayer and thanks later valenti and others stopped for a beer at the nearby home of nico sell the tech entrepreneur brennan and tynan sat at sell table with a view of maverick talking about the peculiar setting goldschmidt had chosen for her official announcement of equity an artificial wave pool in central california with a crowd of smallwave pro a if to avoid even the slightest association with the woman who fought for changeweve been pushing for equality for a while this isnt a sudden decision goldschmidt said in that news conference this ha been something that weve been working on for year i asked goldschmidt what role the committee for equity in woman surfing played in pushing the world surf league toward equal access and pay goldschmidt said that the committee had a strong opinion but that the world surf league consulted many group and individual i pressed her to name one but she declined governor newsom had no such reservation in an email referring to the committee for equity in woman surfing he said i applaud the courage of the athlete and activist who fought for this victory and i am hopeful that this will inspire the next generation of daring athlete and activist with the audacity to challenge the status quothe first surf contest to offer equal cash prize for men and woman ended up taking place at jaw this past november before dawn that day in a misty downpour foot wave broke with exceptional power and forecaster called for wave to reach a terrifying foot even male bigwave surfer watching from the cliff worried that condition might become unacceptably dangerous an argument had also been raging in bigwave circle about whether world surf league judging criterion for contest and the annual big wave award were encouraging surfing that wa too risky grant washburn who sits on the athleteselection committee for the maverick contest called the constant emphasis on commitment combined with cash prize akin to dangling a carrot over a volcano championing what amounted to suicidal base jump in pursuit of money and gloryvalenti and moller told me they were more concerned about their responsibility to prove that woman could surf big wave with the same bravery and skill a men even if that meant mortal risk still for safety and performance reason they asked the world surf league to run the woman division at the jaw contest first thing that morning before the wave became impossibly massive alms and moller competed in the first heat with a french surfer named justine dupont who suffered a badly dislocated shoulder and knee on her second wave and a young brazilian named raquel heckert who work a a cashier and care for the elderly on oahu and had an inflatable vest only because a brazilian rock band bought one for her kennelly and valenti competed in the second heat against erickson and isabelle leonhardt a mexican dentist who had been fixing teeth in the city of manzanillo when she received a lastminute invitation sent her mother on a threehour roundtrip bus to collect her inflatable vest and then took a bus five hour to catch a redeye to houston for a connecting flight to mauierickson stuck to the old traditionalist approach taking off where she knew she could make the drop gliding beautifully across big wall to safety valenti played a more contemporary game catching a footer at it biggest and steepest spot she made the initial airdrop only to have her board lurch sideways and throw her off driven to the ocean floor and rescued by a jet ski driver valenti found herself on a boat with no memory of how she got theremoments later still badly dazed valenti paddled into the final heat with kennelly alms moller and erickson but she concluded she had a concussion and did not compete the swell began to build a foot wave roared like jet engine and broke with enough power to splinter wooden ship easily the biggest and most dangerous surf ever faced by woman in a contest erickson stuck to her oldschool way while alms launched herself off the top of a monster only to have wind blow her board out from under her and send her on a foot plummet through space kennelly embodying the contemporary deathorglory approach a much a any something man charged repeatedly into the scariest part of the scariest wave and wiped out on every single one thrilling world surf league announcer who applauded what one of them called the warrior in keala kennelly who ha obviously been the most committed woman throughout this competition she won the dayduring an award ceremony the next evening at a restaurant and bar called charleys kennelly looked exhausted but ebullient about her win and also a new and unexpected honor she had just become the first female invitee in the decadeslong history of the eddie aikau invitational at waimea bay for the seasonas a group of young surfer girl had their picture taken with kennelly i recalled a speech she gave in at the grove theater in anaheim calif during the annual big wave award one of kennelly teahupoo barrel had won barrel of the year in a socalled open category that includes men marking the first time a female surfer had ever won onstage that night behind a black lectern that made her seem tiny kennelly leaned into a microphone when i wa a little girl i didnt really want to be a little girl she said because when i wa a little girl i kept getting told you cant do that because youre a girl she rattled off a litany woman cant surf ok woman can surf but woman cant get barreled woman cant surf big wave visibly moved she continued so who i really really want to thank is everybody in my life that told me you cant do that because youre a woman because that drove me to dedicate my life to proving you wrong and it been so damn fun finally kennelly confessed that even she never thought a woman could win a men bigwave award and thanked everyone for sharing this moment

rueda said they are encouraged to understand their part in the injury processhave you ever i asked suggested that incoming freshman read synopsis of the boston university report before they signed

actively pursuing the investigative processthat answer sidestep the key point there is much unknown about brain trauma and cte including the role of individual body chemistry and the precise nature of

audience a recently a now the sport is confronting a fallow period with unfortunate timing espn the new ufc broadcast partner ha taken over the sport payperview distribution and will air the main event exclusively on it streaming network espnits at a crossroad david carter the director of the sport business institute at the university of southern california said of ufcthe company alignment with espn usher a once renegade sport deeper into the mainstream on top of a reported fiveyear billion deal struck last may that wrested the complete medium right package from fox espn paid an undisclosed fee to extend that deal through and become the only purveyor of payperview fight in the united state they will be shown exclusively on espn which cost monthly main card will cost an extra espn ha not released any viewership data from espn beyond acknowledging in it quarterly earnings call in february that two million subscriber had signed up and that it attracted new subscriber in january when the initial deal with ufc kicked in it is unknown for instance whether people signed up for espn and then left and if so how manyeven before mcgregor retired on tuesday carter said he believed this wa a critical time for ufc which is owned by endeavor a sport entertainment and fashion content marketing companyour metric show that our fan base ha significantly scaled said mark shapiro the president of endeavor and that mma viewer are buying the fight a much for the slate of fight a they are any one individual fighteraccording to nielsen data through five live telecast on espns main channel ufc is averaging viewer or more than twice a many a it fight averaged on f last yearstill ufc appears to have reached a critical juncture in the same manner a other league like the nba that struggled with sustainable star power during transition seasonsthe challenge for ufc carter said is to develop the new fighter to supplant the old guard when to some extent fan will have to pay for an espn subscription to get to know themand lately casual sport fan have been hearing about ufc largely in connection with fight cancellation or suspension or in mcgregors case a suspension for his role in a brawl after he lost a fight in la vega and criminal charge after he wa caught on video last spring outside barclays center throwing a metal dolly into the window of a bus carrying ufc athlete and employee he pleaded guilty in a brooklyn court to one count of disorderly conductthats not limited to ufc at all carter said but at some point i think at some point casual fan get fatigued by the circus element of itby selling the right to espn ufc no longer ha to worry about some of the uncontrollable element that affect payperview purchase injury suspension retirement the venture is somewhat risky for espn a it try to determine whether a substantial audience will quickly adapt to a new network and subscribe to espn but the deal represents a longterm investmentespn did not make anyone available for comment but a partnership with the network improves ufcs chance of becoming a topic of conversation on espn program like sportscenter and first takei do think they need to do a better job of building star making people stand out chuck liddell one of the early ufc star said in a telephone interview there so many fight now back in the day there used to be six ufc event now there what under espns deal there will be night of live event including on payperview which will increase the need for appealing fight zelaznik joined ufc in in the middle of liddells career he said he could not recall feeling anxious about unearthing new talent or there being a lullthe biggest difference right now is that when i came on ufc wa the only game in town it wa the entire cola category said zelaznik who oversaw ufcs payperview and digital business and is now the chief executive officer at glory sport international now ufc is clearly the coke and pepsi and then there a lot of rc cola and shasta the uniqueness ha sort of worn off the novelty isnt what it wa people are familiar with it so how do you make people carethat question is central to the growth of ufc which want to protect itself for the future while providing a return on espns investment michael berman executive vice president of programming and general counsel for in demand which until recently distributed ufc fight to cable system said that interest had declined over the past few year except for a few megaeventsacross it card in and ufc attracted payperview purchase a threshold for what berman considers substantial only four time ufc event topped a million once when khabib nurmagomedov defeated mcgregor in october according to mmapayoutcom a website that track the business of mixed martial art in it card from to when rousey and mcgregor were fighting regularly payperview bout surpassed purchase and seven exceeded a milliontheres so much content available that it becomes very difficult to differentiate between a lowerlevel payperview and a fight that had been appearing on fox or f berman said if youve got three week of ufc programming and two are available for free and one is the one thats really ha to stand out to pay that money without the big star it difficult to convince people to spendthats especially true berman added now that people are spending on other streaming service like hulu netflix or dazn and will have to determine whether they want to pay for anotherespn ha that brand name and can build off that but theyre not the only game in town carter saidthe best

should stick to layup yet by shooting layup and hook shot and dunk he finished the game with point and assistshe is the best fundamentally unsound player in the nba and you wonder how this still unformed yearold star and a gimpyknee center can stumble into the nba finalsin a strange way on this night embiids absence liberated his teammate they shot percent from point range to the net percent

attracted not much attention this wintervan wagenen a smoothtalking agent who ha become a smoothtalking general manager smiled genially let be candid here he said the outfield is probably not our top priority at this point jeff mcneil a career minor leaguer until last july wa going out to the outfield van wagenen said and he give u another really good weaponthat the mets a little market club hard by flushing bay will play it cheap is a wellestablished fact but van wagenen speaks the management palaver of choice this parsimonious winter no one want to spend moneythe cub the yankee the dodger the giant the cardinal the brave the ranger and the angel all have apparently passed on making a bid for harper and machado each franchise is owned by a wealthy man or family in a wealthladen sport and all could presumably find a place in the lineup for one of these young star and yet for the second season in a row at a time of the offseason when the best free agent typically would have already signed handsome new contract most owner have tucked away their wallet and claimed to need no more talentcandidly van wagenens reasoning for the mets disinterest is good for a giggle mcneil is a lateblooming minor league second baseman who in a few nice month in the major hit three home run and knocked in run he a career infielder without a career to speak ofharper by way of no comparison

director of collective bargaining told me at a time when industry revenue and club valuation are growing for the second straight offseason an alarming number of club are declining to compete for the many talented playersmajor league baseball official claim to see no problem the deputy commissioner dan halem helped negotiate the last collective bargaining agreement with the player union and he say labor portion of nearly billion in baseball revenue ha held steady his estimate includes player in baseball vast minor league system though none of whom are in the union and some fair number of whom

reasonable expectation they will produce at a high level for many season to comethe owner have perhaps snookered a baseball union grown a touch complacent they regularly manipulate the service time of young player which work this way team control player for six season before they become eligible for free agency so club put thumb to scale and wait to bring up even their very best player until late may or early june this push back the rookie service time and save the club many million of dollarsthe difference when a player reach free agency is grand in harper led the league with homer and a on base percentage and wa voted the national league most valuable player he earned million next year he is likely to pull down close to millionthe union ha tended to tolerate service manipulation

advertisementsupported bysports of the timesby michael powella few week back i drove across central florida that flatland of farm and cattle and sweetsmelling orange grove in the company of a childhood friend peter kurz and we talked a we have been prone to do over many year about our lifelong obsession with the new york metswe recalled our preadolescent battery at the soldier and sailor monument on manhattan upper west side my imaginary tom seaver tossing fastball to his imaginary jerry grote we got everyone out of course willie stargell and roberto clemente frank and brook robinson too because that wa just the way tom terrific rolledthe mets inhabited our consciousness a happens when the hypnotic beauty of baseball sink it hook in kid those mets those world champion guy have been stepping into mortality shadow for year now tommie agee and donn clendenon ed charles and tug mcgraw all gone so we can not lay claim to shock that another star will now be moving off the stageexcept that seaver wa the immortal the forever young so composed and so fiercely competitive and so analytical about his effort now his family say that at age he suffers from dementia and we will see no more of him in public life he will tend to his vineyard in napa a long a he canread about the seaver family announcement that the baseball legend ha dementia and will retire from public life that is not how i will remember him and maybe thats the point of his withdrawal he wa a powerful stocky pitcher from california and he dominated his mound like a tenor astride his stage he would pull off his cap and run his hand through that thick shock of hair and then ready himself and rear and toss and rear and toss no need to put a second clock on him out there on his mound he wa pure business and if a batter fiddled around too much he just might sneak a hard fastball under the batter chin by way of a reminder to buckle downhe perfected the dropandthrust delivery dropping so far down a he threw that his measure of a good night wa whether his right knee had dirt on it from dragging on the mound no weight work and iron sled for him he ran and he worked out with light weight and still that fastball crackledmagic could happen any night he pitched and so you tried to wheedle your parent into letting you stay up and watch with them on the blackandwhite wor channel broadcast or youd curl up in bed with a transistor radio and listen to bob murphy paint the picture for you of seaver tossing and tossingdata can be a sportswriting crutch although it also true that baseball without statistic is like the bible without word so in seaver went with a earned run average he also threw five completegame shutoutsi recently took a look at the prevailing and too little questioned orthodoxy that starting pitcher should not go more than six or seven inning into a game by way of making a point seaver became my insane outlier if hitter wanted to get to him they were welladvised to swing early before seaver tuned up his curve and that live snake of a fastball his career era in the first inning of a game wa in the last three inning his lifetime era wa and forgive me my statistical drunkenness but peakperformance tom tilted into absurdity in he pitched in the ninth inning time and surrendered not a single runoh yes in september of that year he went with an era all this courtesy of baseballreferencecomseaver like his peer bob gibson and juan marichal and jim palmer grooved on competition that wa never more true than in when the mets became the most unlikely team in baseball history to reach the world series stumbling into the postseason with a motley record of many mets had been injured that season they fell into one ditch after another and yet somehow they dusted themselves off and made it to the series against the vastly more powerful oakland asthat series went a taut seven game and seaver facing off against reggie jackson wa alone worth the price of admission reggie had led the american league in home run and run batted in that year and seaver wa seaver with a era and strikeout reggie strutted to the plate wigglewagging his bat ready for the struggle seaver looked in to grote for the sign but there really wa not much doubt what the call would bemy mind eye recall seaver throwing more or le nothing but fastball mano a mano he got jackson and jackson got him seaver wa perhaps not at his best in that series a he actually lost a game and had a era he also struck out men in inningsthis fairy tale ended badly seaver wanted more money and the mets board chairman m donald grant who wa imperious to the point of selfsatire bridled at the help acting up goaded by dick young a reactionary columnist for the daily news grant sent seaver into exile in cincinnati if that city by the ohio river wa to be his elba he made do well enough going in his first year therenone of it felt right though he wa the essential met he returned in the midst of the mets dark age and the team lost game he wa an old man in baseball term the vigor had left his fastball but he still fashioned a reasonable season with a era he gave up up just hit in inningshe moved on an itinerant starter and won game at age for the white sox a year later he called it quits he had a hall of fame career one of the best in the history of the game and his cumulative career earnings in year totaled a hair under million or roughly what an average relief pitcher make in today gameme i remember trying to mimic that dropandthrust motion of his and i recall riding the no

to find a way to end the crisis pakistan prime minister imran khan himself a former cricket star made a move in that direction and gained an international publicity coup when he released an indian

try not to delve into topic that are too controversiala simple guide to the root of the conflict and what could happen nextthis is striking given how much time the club member spend together game last some six hour and afterward the club member will often spend another six hour eating dinner and drinking together in the winter when they dont play cricket they play poker in a large upstairs room in mr singhs home decorated with dozen of cricket trophy and nearly a many bottle of liquor the amount of socializing ha led the club to adopt an unofficial motto we also play cricketthere have been time

onceinageneration asset their most and perhaps only popular player and traded him to the dallas maverick on thursday for potsherd and trinketsactually point of information porzingis wa not even the center of the transaction the knicks tossed him in a a sweetener to persuade the maverick to also take the putative shooting guard tim hardaway and his frightful contract it wa steve mill the team president whose feel for failure is bred in the bone who handed hardaway that million deal two year ago now mill and the rest of the knicks vaunted leadership group have traded porzingis to get rid of ithad i been able to reach mark cuban the maverick owner for comment on his porzingis heist i can only assume he would have dissolved into uncontrollable laughterwe live in a national age of delusion and unapologetic rulebreaking so perhaps there is a pleasingly nefarious explanation for this trade if so knicks management should cling to it like a barnacle on the hull of a sinking ship perhaps the knicks have successfully tampered with another team asset and know that kevin durant or kyrie irving or both will sign in the summer now that the franchise ha plenty of cap spacebut i would put the chance that the knicks could pull off something that clever and diabolical at percent when in doubt it is wisest to bank on inexplicable incompetenceporzingis apparently helped set all this off by requesting a trade a a foot yearold coming off a serious knee injury he represented a conundrum for management do you commit this summer to a longterm contract of the sort that would tickle the tummy of croesus let assume the knicks crack medical and rehabilitation staff warned that his future looked iffyif so why wouldnt knicks management dangle porzingis for a week or more to interested team and let natural competitive instinct come into play around the league when healthy porzingis is a top player and that made him a rare asset instead the knicks traded him posthaste for the aging center deandre jordan and a talented but raw point guard dennis smith jr the knicks already have raw point guard so maybe management succumbed to a collectthemall feverall theory and psychological analysis are welcomeive followed the knicks for decade now and my son soon contracted my affliction like resident in a smallpox ward we often debate whether we have divined one obscure reason or another for faint hope which is why i hopped the subway a week ago and went to barclays center to watch the knicks take on the brooklyn netsit wa a desultory affair at time but it did feature a net team that is climbing in the standing with surprising speed in contrast to the knicks who are hurtling happily downward and the net played like men returned from a neardeath experience happily surprised to posse a winning record after four losing season in the hades of the nbato his credit the net general manager sean mark ha executed a smart rebuild with a fishmonger eye for plucking useful talent out of the discard pool the net play a swarming defense with a collective bounce and their waitwhoisthatguy nonames are long on desire and short on distorting ego it wa possible to daydream that if only they could sign a durant or a kawhi leonard a a free agent the net could be a genuine terror in the eastern conferencethe knicks offer terror of a different sort they decided this season to double down on what they have done instinctually for so many year and devote their energy to pure losing they are superb at it entering friday game against boston their record stood at which assures them a high draft pick in junethe modern nba is an upstairsdownstairs league and run a twotier competition the upstairs version is staged by the top or so team and is all about winning and praying that your team will not face the golden state warrior until late in the playoff at which point you will be excused for exiting quickly and foot firstthe downstairs version involves a halfdozen team and the point is to become the worst of the worst and pray you can draft a young stud who will turn around your franchise the worstrun team return year after year to this brackish well this is the game at which the knicks currently exceland there is indeed much unlovely about these knicks their defense occupies a netherworld between theoretical and clueless their nowtraded shooting guard hardaway appeared to have had his conscience surgically removed and would shoot anywhere at any time and none too successfullyand yet and yet i thought these knicks offered a rough hope they have the youngest team in the league a group of foal and a few might even posse lasting talent put them together with porzingis and something intriguing might emergefriends resisted these optimistic blandishment and i dug that in james dolan the knicks have an owner who meddles and hire and fire team president and coach like a mad king in the past season the knicks finished with a winning record precisely twice this one will be no betterstill i felt hope the new coach david fizdale is a clever basketball man who seemed ok with playing dorm father to a collection of teenager this week fizdale pointed to the philadelphia er

giving the quadratic dude a seizure i turned to baseball reference and selected pitcher from the past halfcentury men who ran the gamut from solid to superb these are the sort of pitcher youd expect to see in the postseason and my list included bobby ojeda mike torrez steve avery tom browning tom seaver steve carlton ferguson jenkins and mazzones troika of hall of famers i examined their performance across game from beginning to endfor most good pitcher their worst inning wa the first once they found a rhythm and once pitch began to crackle they became progressively more difficult to hit tom seavers career earned run average in the first inning wa his era for the last three inning of a game that dreaded third and fourth time through the batting order stood at so current analytic wisdom doe a headstandby way of insane outlier seaver won game in and helped pitch the miracle mets to a world series championship he pitched the ninth inning time that season and surrendered not a single runthis is a familiar pattern mike mussina gave up fewer run on average in the seventh eighth and ninth inning than he did in the first three he wa at his best in the ninth inning the best inning for ron darling and david well wa the eighth requisite caveat by definition these pitcher were having a good outing if they made it to the late inningsif you hoped to beat dodger pitcher fernando valenzuela you were advised to start hacking early he had a career era of in the first inning when valenzuela wa still pitching in the ninth inning and he got there roughly time in his career his era wa luis tiant the red sox and cleveland ace wa nearly a tough he pitched just over time in the ninth inning and had an era of greg maddux had a era in his first three inning and a from the seventh inning through the ninth and while he possessed a good fastball it wa not a threedigit express train one spring training in the mids maddux who in a year career piled up fairly meaningful win asked to speak with the team young pitchersmazzone nodded sure thing mad dog whatever you want the coach lined up the young guy and maddux walked overyou know why i am a millionaire because i can put my fastball wherever i want to maddux told them do you know why i own beachfront property in la because i can change speed ok questionsmazzone wa not enraptured by pitch count he would not push pitcher to stupid extreme but he refused to hew to limit without basis in medical fact he had pitcher run and throw every day in between start and they had remarkably few injury in one threeyear stretch his pitcher missed a single startwe kept track of pitch and i had a clicker he said but if tommy glavine get a popup on a changeup hell im not counting thathe recalled a brave vice president by the name of henry aaron who offered advice about the danger of radar gun intoxication dont worry about pure speed aaron said you can run a jet airliner through the strike zone and i will figure out how to rope it down the line locate a ball that move at my knee and im outall of which brings me back to the mets a team ive followed for many often hapless decade their manager mickey callaway sound a enamored of pitch count a his peer are all of this seeps into the brainpan of young pitcher who labor under the impression that five or six inning constitute a day worksyndergaard is a fine pitcher and susceptible to the idiocy of the age a year ago he pumped iron in the offseason in hope of throwing even harder than mile per hour and that season he blew a muscle in his side he appears to accept the notion that pitching through the seventh inning lie beyond the limit of human exertion and last season he posted a era in that inninghis rotation mate are no different on the rare occasion they pitched into the seventh inning zack wheeler and steven matz posted calamitous era of and mazzone went to cooperstown in for the hall of fame induction of maddux and glavine they got to yakking before the ceremony and mazzone asked what they would have done if in the course of pitching a world series shutout he had come to the mound to pull them from the gameglavine looked at him smiled thinly and replied mazz we were going to have a fight on that moundadvertisement

sleeve and his suit jacket pucker and strain against the motion then he is gonestones reprise naturally carry much le historical weight his gesture almost get lost in the crowd he ha to angle his arm up very high to be seen and instead of holding his finger steady a nixon did he waggle them around just to make sure we all get it nixon looked like a pope on a balcony elevated isolated imperious stone look like a kid trying to get a radio signal with a tinfoil antenna the gesture is premeditated and insistent he actually make it twice first at the beginning of his appearance and then again at the end the people around him are hardly even paying attention they mill around discussing other thing even those holding up their cellphone look bored it is a perfect little modern tableau witness

gamerover the past few week the gaming community ha been consumed by a strange episode one involving a game called overwatch a player named ellie and a socalled social experiment gone wrongfor the unfamiliar overwatch is a firstperson shooter video game in which team of six player must work together to accomplish an objective while avoiding being killed by opposing team a of may there were approximately million overwatch player regularly battling it out worldwide making the game one of the most popular out thereit is also a spectator sport with serious money at stake the overwatch league is a professional esports organization akin to the nba and the nfl that hand out million of dollar in prize money and brings in million of viewer this league is in turn fed by the overwatch contender a series of tournament designed to identify talented young player who could turn professionalit will surprise no one to learn that a vast majority of these player professional and amateur alike are male and that woman who venture into these space face an especially unpleasant environment woman who compete professionally in esports face heckling from teammate and fan and are sometimes accused of serving a front for male player at the same time team owner with an eye toward reaching a potentially gigantic untapped market of young female viewer remain eager to diversify their roster to provide an entry point for girl who might never have thought of video game a being for theminto this toxic storm came ellieellie no last name given appeared at first to be a previously undiscovered highly ranked female player whod seemingly come out of nowhere to dominate the overwatch leader board a such she wa a tempting recruit for the contender team second wind which according to a statement released this month had found itself desperately in need of a new player to fill a hole in it rosterellie however proved reticent to reveal anything about her identity other than her online alias some fan argued that she did so with good reason the esports world ha an ugly history of haranguing female player to the breaking point in for instance hyerim lee a professional competitor known a magicamy in another popular game hearthstone wa accused by a fellow player of being nothing more than a pretty face and a front for an anonymous man or team of player these accusation led to an investigation m lee wa vindicated and her employer the team tempo storm offered to support magicamy in an attempt to clear her name however in the wake of the negative attention m lee opted to retire from professional play insteadin another professional player this time an overwatch specialist named kim seyeon and known a geguri also faced charge of cheating from her male competitor though in her case she wa accused of simply hacking the game itself not of having a man play for her at least two player were so confident that she must have been pulling the wool over the community eye that they staked their career on it promising not only to apologize but also to retire from the league if they were proved wrong to their credit they did so following a livestreamed event where she demonstrated her preternatural mouse skill for all to seeso there wa reason enough for ellie to want to keep her identity a secret and second wind indicated it would respect ellies desire for privacy others however remained suspicious and soon enough the cycle of harassment abuse threat and call for doxxing began doxxing is the online practice of publishing people personal private information without their consent not long after ellie announced that she would not be playing for second wind after all it seemed a though yet another female esports athlete had been driven away from the scenebut this time the story had a twist soon after her early retirement wa announced another highly accomplished but a yet undrafted overwatch player calling himself punisher confessed to a fellow player that he wa in fact the man behind the ellie persona and that the entire fiasco wa intended to function a a kind of social experiment in other word it turned out that ellie really had been lying about her identity all alongthe strange story of ellie underscore a few facet of esports that still make the industry unusual even a it ha expanded into a multimilliondollar business the first is the degree to which it allows for anonymity unlike player in traditional sport esports athlete are not necessarily expected to be physically present at an event to compete and the overwatch contender rule do not require participant to use their legal namesthe second is that esports pose no physical barrier to mixedgender competition it is a realm in which quick thinking creative problemsolving and handeye coordination not size or strength are needed to succeeddespite this or perhaps because of it fan and gamers have erected a series of informal psychological barrier against female participation some male player will go so far a to throw their game in protest against playing with woman indeed one of the player on ellies team second wind team captain robert blohm haku went a far a to say that female should not be in topranking game with him he later tweeted an apology these barrier and gatekeeping even extend to fandom female gamers with no professional aspiration are regularly accused by their male counterpart of being fake geek girl which certainly isnt helpful for an industry trying to expand it viewershipif punisher wa conducting a social experiment it isnt clear what he wa trying to prove wa it intended to demonstrate the trial and tribulation that female esports athlete must endure on their way to the top if so for many fan the fact that no woman ever actually existed proved only that game medium outlet were a little too quick to call the community sexist wa it to demonstrate that woman actually have an easier time than men when it come to achieving success because punisher himself went unsigned while ellie wa snapped up immediately if so it worth asking why second wind wa willing to take such a humongous risk on an unknown quantity what did it see a the potential benefit what public relation problem did they think she might be able to help solveonly one thing is certain punishers social experiment did not take place in a vacuum and the memory of it will linger in the overwatch community for good or ill in the aftermath of ellies swift rise and fall woman trying to break into professional esports will probably face greater pressure than ever to prove their existence to male fan that is not a good outcome either for the woman themselves or for an industry that need themmegan condis is an assistant professor of game study at texas tech

advertisementsupported byon college basketballby marc tracyif the opinion published friday night in a landmark college sport antitrust case were a novel then it villain would be the ncaain a novellalength page opinion united state district court judge claudia wilken criticizes berates even mock the ncaa for it refusal to allow college to compensate player for their valuable labor beyond a scholarship and related cost of attendance all in the name of something they call amateurismdefendants nowhere define the nature of the amateurism they claim consumer insist upon said wilken referring to the ncaa and several of it richest most prominent conferenceseven if they had wilken continued she pointed to numerous exception when player could effectively be paid player are paid beyond scholarship all the time in untold million of dollar invested in training facility in gift for participating in bowl game in fund available to purchase lossofvalue insurancethe rule that permit limit or forbid studentathlete compensation and benefit do not follow any coherent definition of amateurism she saidthe decision stem from a longrunning case in which a group of college athlete sued the ncaa and athletic conference that participate in the top level of basketball and football they contended that the ruling body of college sport had colluded to enact a system that unfairly limit the compensation they receive when they are attending and competing for their university the ncaa and the conference argue that those limit are essential for promoting amateurism and enhancing the value of college sport and undergraduate educationin her decision wilken seems to say that those rule did restrain trade producing significant anticompetitive effectsthe clerk wilken added on the final page with the majestic understatement of a good literary denouement shall enter judgment for the plaintiff classso why doesnt it feel a if the group of athlete who pursued the litigation to end the ncaas rule won the case why did they and their star sport labor lawyer jeffrey kessler not get the outcome they most fervently soughtdespite finding that the ncaa wa violating federal law wilken turned away the plaintiff main proposed remedy which wa also the logical one to lift the supposedly lawbreaking cap on compensation that mean the continuation of a status quo where so many player feel they are working basically for free hows thatwhen you apply a uniquely muddled set of law to a unique industry this is the kind of ruling you get said gabe feldman who directs tulanes sport law program and teach antitrust law the unique muddle to which he wa referringthe upshot of friday ruling pending a likely appeal is that the ncaa may continue to cap payment to athlete after all with the limited exception of expense that are educational in nature think computer or cost related to internship or postgraduate scholarshipsdont think stipend of or or because the player receiving it is good enough that he or she is worth even more than that to the college in increased ticket sale and medium exposure and television right paymentsno wonder several of the defendant responded this weekend with the kind of equanimity one doe not expect from party that technically lost a casethe decision reaffirms the fundamental principle of the collegiate athletic model and of amateurism pacific commissioner larry scott said in a statement studentathletes are first and foremost student who attend college to receive an education and to prepare themselves for success in life while also pursuing athletic excellencescotts statement is more aspirational than descriptive there are basketball player who conclude their college career before finishing even a year of collegesimilarly the reaction from playersrights advocate wa more muted than you might expect postvictorythis is progress but it just one step ramogi huma of the college athlete player association said in a text message this ruling still treat athlete a secondclass citizen no other student or citizen is subject to such harmful economic pricefixing especially one imposed by a repeat antitrust violator that doe not have an antitrust exemptionhow can a judge rule that a law is being broken but allow the lawbreaking to continueaccording to feldman the answer includes a muchdisputed antitrust principle known a the rule of reason in some case including this one the rule call for anticompetitive activity to be overturned only if there is a different system that could provide the positive benefit of the anticompetitive system without suppressing other competition a muchwilken determined that amateurism wa crucial to college sport commercial appeal and allowed it to compete with professional sport even if doing so required it to apparently violate antitrust lawthe court doe credit the importance to consumer demand of maintaining a distinction between college sport and professional sport she saidcourts have given sport league a wide berth when it come to antitrust feldman said the argument is that sport are uniqueafter all sport can not really exist unless say team are allowed to agree to the same rule in men basketball even though that might technically constitute collusion in any other realm of commercewilken wa also following precedent most of all she wa following a precedent set by the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit her circuitin an earlier case known a obannon the appellate court agreed with part of a wilken finding at the district court level that the ncaa ban on

ruptured achilles tendon her pain wa not just her owni love stewie and wa heartbroken to hear about her injury especially coming off an unbelievable wnba season and world cup elena delle donne the washington mystic star and a former league most valuable player said shes just a great player competitor and friend she will be missed this year but i know she will come back stronger than everstewart is not only a beloved player for the seattle storm she is also a prominent symbol of an enduring issue in professional woman basketball in the united state it player season never enda rookie selected in this month wnba draft will make to in base salary and nobody in the league will earn a base salary of a much a this coming seasonbecause of that many of the player in the wnba maximize their earning window by heading to europe and asia where independent owner free of salary cap can offer them lucrative opportunitiesthere is a price to pay however endless season bleeding into one another a physical psychological and emotional toll and the player say a heightened risk of injurya few week ago victoria vivians a firstround pick of the indiana fever tore her anterior cruciate ligament playing in israel she like stewart will miss the wnba seasonthese were only the biggest latest injury consider one by amanda zahui b the liberty center who play for sopron basket in hungaryi just twisted my ankle really bad she said in a phone interview in the past week it a swollen potato but i got to practice through it we dont really have the time to take off everyone twist their ankle everyone get bone bruise in their knee and suchall of which elevates the question of how much wnba player are paid and whether a framework can be established to keep more of them in the united state during the league offseasonive always said everybody that play overseas in the wnba need therapy mystic guard kristi toliver who spent a decade on the hamster wheel of woman professional basketball before being hired this offseason a an assistant coach for the nbas washington wizard said ahead of her th wnba campaign it just a real thing just so much that you go through with the travel and being away from loved one family or significant others and trying to manage and deal with all these different thing that are coming at youbut you have a highlevel job and you have to perform well in order to keep itending the financial need for nonstop play is a prime focus of terri jackson president of the woman national basketball player association it appears the league is supportive a well which is not surprising given that the quality of play would most likely rise and player who remained in their home market could promote their team yearroundi think it a dream a goal of the union to grow the league to the point where player can work in it yearround and not have to endure the risk and the rigor of overseas play of that month calendar jackson said it a matter that concern me it a matter that is top of mind for the executive committee and our larger cba committeethat focus is particularly important right now after the player association opted out of it collective bargaining agreement with the league late last year so the injury to stewart while reflecting a longstanding reality ha also shed new light on the way these player earn a livingfirst and foremost our thought are with breanna and we wish her a speedy recovery mark tatum the acting wnba president and nba deputy commissioner said in an email the wnba and it team and player share a commitment to growing the league business and building on our ongoing work to provide greater professional opportunity for player in the offseasonthe league ha good reason to want a pathway to limiting if not ending overseas play from player the team are consistently affected by the toll it take on it playersthe yearround play for wnba player is a detriment to the wnba product minnesota lynx coach cheryl reeve said the physical and mental toll it take on the league elite player is reflected in some of the league best sitting out the wnba season to rest a well a these player sustaining injuriesreeve said the rest which cut into the wnba season is critical for elite player who are asked to perform at their highest level day in and day out at home and abroadit isnt possible to sustain an elite level without these break she saidthe new way forward can take many form with change in the base salary merely one of the tool available toliver for instance is coaching in the nba this season but because of restrictive rule in place from the previous cba is making just to do so a comprehensive pathway to getting wnba player more opportunity on nba coaching staff and in front office during the wnba offseason could significantly change the calculation for player by itselfjackson spoke optimistically about how that process wa going though even the work to keep her own side informed requires timezone gymnastics with her leadership scattered all over the worldwe could have a meeting at am or at pm eastern time just because we have folk in or weve had folk in russia and poland and china turkey jackson said and so my executive committee just say get it done so thats what we do she recalled an executive committee member nneka ogwumike jumping on a call from china at midnightthe two side have until the conclusion of the season to come to an agreementthe league ha also signaled it willingness it desire to have a really collaborative relationship with the player and to hear and to understand the concern and how to make this better jackson said this is good forward movement i think thats where we arethat come a welcome news to player like aja wilson who ha followed stewart path in many way stewart wa the top overall pick in wilson in like stewart wilson won an ncaa championship then wa the wnba rookie of the year and like stewart wilson went straight from college ball to the wnba to a stint overseas last year in china before an injury ended her seasonits definitely not an easy route at all wilson said i think thats what make u just that elite a professional athlete because our body take on so much but yet we still perform every single game i mean when stewie got hurt she wa in the championship game she wa playing at the highest level that she could overseas it broke my heartwilson too expressed hope that stewart injury would shine a light on this scheduling issue zahui b agreed though she doesnt have much time to worry about it her team is in the hungarian league semifinal if her team sweep she said she will finish her season on may then fly home to sweden to see her family on may before reporting to new york for training camp with the liberty by may on

kansa city royal champion visit the bronx this weekend the houston astros swept the yankee last week and this week the yankee swept the boston red sox who have gone from pristine to pitiful since claiming the crown last fallthere is nothing quite like an emphatic sweep of their rival even in a twogame series to clear away the cloud over yankee stadium after a blowout on tuesday and a comeback on wednesday the yankee and their patchwork roster seem capable of weathering their crush of injury and contending yet againtheres always a guy down and a guy up and a guy stepping in trying to pick each other up the best we can starter ja happ said after working six and onethird inning in wednesday victory were hoping we get a bunch of guy back but at the same time these game count the same weve got to hang inthe best way to do that is with starting pitching on tuesday james paxton became the first yankee since to record at least eight shutout inning and strikeout in a game a day later happ improvised after struggling with his fourseam fastball using twoseamers and changeups to keep the game close until brett gardner delivered the goahead grand slam in the seventhwith paxton happ masahiro tanaka cc sabathia and domingo german in their rotation the yankee should keep most game close enough for the bullpen and the offense to give them a chance paxton and happ who had combined for zero quality start in six outing before this week showed that in vivid detailthose are characterbuilders manager aaron boone said those are thing in the course of the season that i think guy benefit from when you kind of break through and are finding your way in a seasonspeaking of breaking through clint frazier homered on tuesday and went for on wednesday raising his average to he is capitalizing on the absence of outfielder aaron hick and giancarlo stanton two of the yankee currently on the injured list and making up for the lost season he endured in after a concussion in spring trainingi wanted to be out on that field but no one could put their hand on my head and work on it and make it feel any better frazier said thats the hard part some of these injury you can go into the training room and they can do certain thing physically to make you feel better and for me it wa a hard one to go through because there wa so much unknown with that injury it lasted a long time manbefore his teammate injury this season frazier had no clear path to playing time with the yankee he started the year in the minor now he is showing why the cleveland indian made him the first high school position player selected in the draft it just might take some roster gymnastics to keep him around when his fellow outfielder return from their injuriesi look forward to those gymnastics boone said adding later he a guy the talent and the bat speed and the ability to impact the ball kind of leap off the screen i think everyone see thatthe yankee saw it in july when general manager brian cashman acquired frazier and justus sheffield from the indian for reliever andrew miller a move that came six day after extracting gleyber torres and billy mckinney from the chicago cub in a deal for closer aroldis chapmancashman played kingmaker that season helping send the indian and the cub to the world series the yankee have not been there in a decade but those deal keep paying off besides the production of frazier and torres their starting shortstop cashman used mckinney to trade for happ and sheffield to trade for paxtonchapman of course returned to the yankee after winning game of the world series for the cub retiring the indian in order in the ninth inning after blowing the save in the eighth that effort under the most intense pressure possible without his best stuff wa instructive for the evolution chapman would eventually have to makehe wa averaging a careerlow mile per hour on his fastball before wednesday according to fangraphs and he is throwing more slider than ever but that slider is still quite effective and he did hit mph against his final hitter on wednesday chapman remains an elite closer and should be the least of the yankee concernsthe biggest question is the depleted lineup but frazier torres luke voit and dj lemahieu seem dangerous enough behind aaron judgewere the yankee so we can bolster our lineup a ton of way frazier said it hard being a young guy trying to break through you need to catch a break sometime you hate it to be at the expense of somebody ability to stay on the field but it happens and it next guy up i want to stay here for a long timeif he can do that the yankee injury epidemic will have led to something lasting frazier deserves the chancei sometimes even forget that i got drafted by the indian because i feel like it wa so long ago he said that wa a special moment for my family to welcome myself into pro ball but im happy that im here i feel like ive found a good homeadvertisement

felt tightness during monday game against the houston astros the yankee gave him some relief the next game by starting him at designated hitter he wasnt in the starting lineup on wednesday coming in a

bleakness of life in a southern ohio village pointed to recent change in the creative writing program a a sign of the university skewed prioritiesit appears that the university will do anything to

advertisementsupported byby john branchgymnastics recently had people on it list swimming had an additional are on the list from taekwondo from figure skating and more from judothe list reflect the hundred of people who have been barred often for sexual misconduct from the federation running these sport a well a others overseeing the development of olympic athlete a few of the name are well known perhaps none more than lawrence g nassar the former team doctor for usa gymnastics who wa sent to prison after being accused of sexually abusing score of young female athletesyet the sheer scope of the list and the inconsistency within them because of differing standard among the organization raise plenty of question not the least of which is whether an effort to collect and publish the name is even legal given that until recently people were disciplined by the governing body each with it own brand of justice there are also question about transparency and whether individual sport are divulging all past offendersthe plan a the united state olympic committee vow to throw open the curtain and let in the light is to get all the name from all the year and all the olympic sport in one place so that people can easily check them before joining a team or hiring a coach or a trainerwhat we want is an environment where across the entire olympic and paralympic family the name of individual who have been banned are readily available said rick adam the united state olympic committee executive who oversees the effort to create a central clearinghouse under what is called the safesport initiativethe olympic committee created the u center for safesport which it spun off a a separate entity in march the idea wa to have a single agency empowered to investigate and rule on accusation of misconduct taking those responsibility away from the organization that run individual sport like usa gymnastics usa swimming caught up in a scandal of it own and otherssafesport doe not publish a list of all people barred from the sport but it doe provide link to the individual federation list on it site and it maintains a searchable online database for all the case in which safesport ha handed down ban or suspension sometimes interim a investigation continue from it inception last year through the end of august safesport handled report of sexual misconduct across nearly every sport the organization said with of those case still open safesport ha meted out lifetime ban so far the organization saidsigns of it early influence and the broader cultural shift toward reporting sex crime can be seen within some of the list provided by various sport governing body before safesport usa track and field had one person on it banned list now it ha when taken together the continually updated list of barred people which include more than lifetime ban for sexual misconduct or abuse in the past month alone ensure that the frequency of child predation in youth sport in america is more fully exposedthis go a whole lot deeper than stopping someone like larry said rachael denhollander a lawyer and former gymnast who wa the first to go public with accusation against dr nassar the number of coach who are predator on the banned list is quite huge the number that are not on these banned list is quite possibly even largersafesport received the backing of federal legislation this year it ha an office in denver a growing crew of investigator and one set of policy and procedure for jurisprudence what it doe not have critic like m denhollander say is the necessary funding or the independence from the usoc and sport organization whose year of oversight fueled the crisis in the first placethe effort to more rigorously compile the name is proving to be a delicate and difficult goal there are about group that govern individual sport under the olympic and paralympic umbrella some with painfully checkered past when it come to handling accusation of sexual misconduct not all have these list or want to share themfor now safesports public database doe not include all the people however many of them there are who were barred before it came into existence in march safesport left it up to the governing body to make those name publicbefore safesport each sport governing group handled it own investigation and doled out it own discipline handling abuse claim could be unwieldy expensive and uncomfortable revealing them could create public relation nightmare which could affect everything from sponsorship to medal countsthe structure fostered environment of secrecy and unexamined allegation part of the concern wa legal exposurenudged by congressional hearing after the nassar case susanne lyon acting chief executive officer of the usoc she ha since been named chairwoman sent a letter to all national governing body on may she instructed each organization to provide detailed information on accusation investigation and suspension or ban that predated safesports launch safesport hope to make that information available publicly by the end of the first quarter of shellie pfohl president and chief executive of safesport said the mission represented a logistical challenge creating a database that link national governing group so they can share information while also giving the public access to all the name and at least some of that information toosafesport ha no reluctance in publishing name of people it ha investigated and barred what about those barred previously some many year ago by one of the national governing bodieswe cant speak to how a case wa investigated how it wa adjudicated and the like m pfohl said thats why were not simply incorporating all the banned list into our searchable database into one databaselegal expert said that safesport and the usoc have the right to publish the information from the sport governing body if it is true and accurate claim of defamation would have to prove that the information is intentionally false argument about the list being an invasion of privacy would be hard to win lawyer said unless there wa some prior agreement to keep name secret such a a settlementby further pushing this information out theyre somewhat vouching for it accuracy and thoroughness said donald lewis a lawyer with experience in sexual misconduct case that could create potential problemssafesport ha no interest in relitigating prior case official said but it may need to examine them jodi balsam a law professor at brooklyn law school who teach sport law there and at new york university said safesport might consider informing people that their name will be a part of the public database and offering them a window of time to present reason they should not be includedbut you cant be immobilized by those litigation risk professor balsam said there is good to be done here with the publication of this information it should be done responsibly in a way that is not only legal but ethicalfor now safesports database reveals little even about the case it ha investigated since only a name the sport the decision date a couple of word to categorize the violation sexual misconduct and the person status such a suspended or permanently ineligiblethe pre report from sport organization are far more varied everything from just a list of name to detailed description of the case a is the case with u figure skating which ha posted it list online for yearsthe information is useless if it stay internal said patricia st peter a past president of the skating organization the purpose is protection to make sure that this doesnt happen again somewhere elseother governing body like usa hockey and the u ski and snowboard association have not made their list public trusting that internal mechanism and background check keep the organization from inadvertently employing those with troublesome paststhere remain some sport organization with no list at all because they have no barred member others are shrouded in cryptic language or blank spacesusa volleyball suspended membership list for example contains people including more than barred in the past year by safesport of the others dating a far back a it can be hard to discern what the infraction wa many simply say a person wa suspended for a violation of the organization code of conduct others are blankusa field hockey ha four people on it barred list but only their name usa diving ha eight barred member listed most accompanied by a list of code number and letter referencing the violation the relevant bylaw when searched separately are vague enough that one person listed wa either involved in sexual misconduct or drug use or bothof the people barred or permanently suspended by usa swimming at least were banished explicitly for sexual misconduct including about by safesport about others were punished for felony related either to sexual misconduct or drug the information doe not delineate most of the rest do not contain information to explain why the people were barredusa gymnastics may have the longest barred list but none of the name have date associated with their ban and about half have no violation listed but refer to safesport which mean that they were sexual misconduct case since nearly others violated an unexplained bylaw that when found elsewhere cover those on sexoffender list or people who have been deemed to have committed sexual misconduct or sexual abuse violationsdr nassars name is on both the list at usa gymnastics and in the database for safesport in neither place is there an explanation of what action led dr nassar to be barred nothing about the hundred of woman who accused him of sexual abuse at his sentencing or the conviction and prison sentence he received amid a maelstrom of attention this yearat usa gymnastics all it say is that dr nassar violated something called bylaw a iii you have to look it up to see that it pertains to sexual misconduct and

tell player that risking your future when you are in your early s is a stupid concept that many player myself included regret carmichael saidthanks to these three the university of colorado ha come closer than most institution to wrestling with an urgent question is running a college football program unconscionablewe should move in the direction of offering lifelong insurance and medical care

director for health and performance noted that the staff train freshman football player to speak up if injured we go over the risk of injury because there is a tie to mental health from any injury rueda said they are encouraged to understand their part in the injury processhave you ever i asked suggested that incoming freshman read synopsis of the boston university report before they signed their health waiver and embarked on a football careerrueda saw no reason for thatthere is no proven direct link between concussion and cte he said there are a number of people who are out there actively pursuing the investigative processthat answer sidestep the key point there is much unknown about brain trauma and cte including the role of individual body chemistry and the precise nature of the most dangerous hit those brain studied by definition came from men who worried about brain degeneration still it appears irrefutable that a link exists and that nutrition and better way of

magnificent linebacker at the university of colorado and played nine year in the nfl earning a super bowl ring with the chicago bear then he returned to colorado and became a linebacker coachhe

advertisementsupported byby howard megdalthe hiring of the wnba point guard kristi toliver a a fulltime assistant coach with the nbas washington wizard while she is still an active player wa widely applauded a a notable new achievement for woman in coachingit followed the san antonio spur hiring of becky hammon and other woman like nancy lieberman and jenny boucek also joining nba coaching staffswith anything you need to see it to be it said briann january a guard for the phoenix mercury and in her offseason an assistant woman basketball coach at arizona state i see it now because of becky because of kristi i see the opportunity that is out there to take that next step in this professional areafor many player the move showed nba team tapping into a longstanding significant pipeline of female talenti think a lot of woman in general are missing out on a lot of good opportunity in which we can be extremely beneficial to any team to any organization no matter our gender said alana beard a veteran los angeles spark guard often mentioned a a coaching candidate by her peersbeard cited the meager pay toliver is to receive this season just because of limit in the wnbas collective bargaining agreement a an extremely important issue for the league to address in negotiation for a new agreement the goal would be making a barrier that ha long been permeable on one side men into woman basketball on the coaching side into a free exchange of talent regardless of gender based on opportunitymany if not most wnba player who are paid significantly le than their male counterpart can not afford to spend their offseason working for so little pay their basketball skill are worth much more into the million of dollar in service of woman league overseasall of those thing on a coach plate to take care of to do that for for an entire nba season is crazy january said id like to break that down and do the math like how much that is a game or how much that is a day that would just be insult to injuryyet some people including commentator on internet site and men basketball fan in real life contend these woman should be happy to have opportunity at allthis attitude rankles many wnba player that even tolivers shot let alone chance for other woman with considerable experience playing and in many case coaching is often thought of a a onesided benefit for those who are hiredbut in many case the nba came calling after seeing the woman excelling on their own tolivers work with the mystic helped bring her to the attention of wizard coach scott brook just a hammon got her opportunity in san antonio because she wa employed by the silver star then owned by the same group a the spur and her wnba coach dan hughes talked her up to spur coach gregg popovichi had a chance to put two party together that i knew would work hughes now the head coach of the seattle storm said i knew becky and i also knew pop and i knew that pop we had a lot of year of conversation about becky he had seen her play when i first brought her to san antonio so to me it wa an opportunity to merge two people that would benefit from each othertoliver ha opened up that discussion in significant way which she said wa a large part of her reasoning for taking the job in the first place in hughes eye it is nothing le than the overdue elimination of whatever combination of sexism and inertia ha prevented the men basketball world from taking advantage of all the talent amassed on the woman side of the sport the next step toward nba team and wnba team and men and woman college basketball program all hiring from the same pool of candidatesas hughes see it it time not because these woman deserve a chance but because every basketball team need more coach like hammon toliver and those who will followi want a world someday where people judge coach on how good a coach they truly are hughes said doesnt matter if theyre male or female doesnt matter their background they can say he a coach or shes a coach and we can use themevery wnba player who stay home instead of playing overseas in her offseason the athlete said is potentially one more person around which to promote the league yearround and that player get to rest too the grind of playing month a year ha led to wnba player like diana taurasi and angel mccoughtry taking season offyou always want to protect your product january said and the majority of our product is being run down and beaten up yearround playing this game so when they come back around to play in the wnba you have half of your player injured playing through nagging thing we still find a way to have a high talent and high level of basketball which is crazy to mewe just have some really strong woman but that need to be a discussion what can we do to provide other opportunity for woman to make income and prepare for the future on a reallife scale something they can live on something that make senseadvertisement
advertisementsupported bynews analysisby mike mcintirenew york university doe not have much of an athletic program but year ago it ran a profitable macaroni company leading indirectly to a decision by congress that college sport if not a collegeowned noodle business should be exempt from taxationtoday a the hugely lucrative football bowl season wrap up college fear that the new tax law signed by president trump could derail their gravy train two provision target coach high salary and booster donation tied to ticket purchase but they need not worry muchthere are no plan to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorship two of the biggest income stream which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into a multibilliondollar business even with the legislative change collegiate sport remain largely tax exempt the beneficiary of a public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defendthe corrosive culture of money in bigtime college sport more than billion a year among the national collegiate athletic association division i sport program wa painfully obvious recently with the indictment of college coach and an adidas executive charged with paying bribe to recruit basketball player and steer them to agentsit wa left to federal prosecutor to issue a statement condemning the criminal influence of money on coach and studentathletesthe taxexempt nature of college sport is not the cause of these problem rather it is rocket fuel for an engine that ha escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decencyto understand how this is possible consider the balance sheet of the atlantic coast conference home of the national champion in football clemson and men basketball north carolina it corporate sponsor include toyota gatorade and geico when the conference filed it annual tax return for it reported about a quarterbillion dollar from broadcasting game for it member university a well a million in other sportsrelated revenue it commissioner earned million the acc wa a huge commercial success with income that would normally generate a huge tax billbut no tax were owed a the conference explained in it filing with the internal revenue service the atlantic coast and it member school are nonprofit charitable organization that place an emphasis on academic excellencethe atlantic coast conference it said seek to maximize the educational and athletic opportunity of it studentathletes while enriching their quality of lifethe magic word here is educational studentathletes have always been considered unpaid amateur engaging in extracurricular activity rather than profitable profession so college sport is deemed part of the educational mission of school and exempt from income taxesthere are specific and contentious interpretation of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era but they have weakened a bigtime college sport ha taken on the trapping of a profitdriven business far removed from the cloistered grove of academe it is only through decade of aggressive lobbying and legal battle that university have managed to avoid income tax on billion of dollar from broadcast right sponsorship and donation from boostersthe seminal moment came in response to an attempt by nyu to extend it taxexempt status to profit generated by c f mueller company a pasta maker that had been donated to it law school in congress took notice and eventually enacted the unrelated business income tax to capture revenue considered ancillary to a nonprofit organization mission sensing the threat the ncaa pressed lawmaker to make sure that the new tax would not apply to money from school sport program accordingly congressional committee report declared that athletic activity of school are substantially related to their educational function even citing the supposed educational benefit of football and basketballso an escape hatch wa opened for college sport over the year the irs ha periodically tried to close it in the late s the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college game and considered treating it a taxable unrelated business income this ignited a spirited lobbying campaign by college and the ncaa until the irs retreated declaring that selling ticket to fan who go to the school stadium wa not all that different from broadcasting game to a television audienceclearly the irs did not foresee the commercialized powerhouse that college sport would become driven by national television viewership for example in the big east conference first year of operation in it earned for the right to broadcast all of it game three decade later espn would offer more than million for those rightsother attempt to tax college sport profit have been mostly rejected by lawmaker in the s congress did an end run around the irs and decreed that corporate sponsorship did not amount to advertising which could be subject to the unrelated business income tax it wa not until the recently approved republican tax plan that lawmaker reversed course eliminating a partial deduction for booster donation tied to the sale of game ticket and imposing an excise tax on college employee salary exceeding million over all however most athletics revenue continues to flow taxfreethat mean the college sport machine keep cranking out expensive entertainment and the scandal that go with it while sheltered by the scholastic equivalent of a cayman island tax dodge if president trump want to repatriate and tax corporate profit stashed offshore he might also consider the

an early tee time i wish we didnt have the rain delay because it made for a little bit longer day but the golf course is playing about a easy a it could and yet merion is really fighting hard we were having a hard time scoring low here it so demanding it such a great track it one of the best ive seen for a u open and we had soft condition and still were all having a hard time getting under par q let get you out to the golf course and show you some of those highlight you bogeyed your first hole but here you are getting back to even phil mickelson it wa a little lefttoright i actually hit l wedge and the tee wa up that wa a big putt because i putted my first hole q you parred the next five and then birdie here at phil mickelson that wa tough one because it wa quick you can see that i tried to have it last a long a possible and it just died in the lip so i read that well and didnt hit a great second shot to give myself a great putt at it but i wa able to make it q you talk about par save keeping the round together how about this phil mickelson it wa critical i wa fortunate to have a decent lie and to have enough green where i could get the ball stopped and i hit a good shot q third at six just a good a that one there phil mickelson well i wa actually trying to fly it further or farther and it came up short and wa it released down i thought if i flew it closer to the hole i might be able to stop it a little bit better but i left myself a nice uphill look at it q bunker is never easy and that wa excellent par save there your second at to set up another birdie phil mickelson this wa my best shot of the day it wa a little iron you cant go two yard long or youre going to have a hard par and i flew it exactly where i wanted to and it ended up with a tap in that wa a good one q not a lot of people are going to birdie this week and you did today phil mickelson it because i made a putt it not like im trying to get that ball close i hit iron to the middle and it wa uphill lefttoright it wa a good a putt from foot a i could have the odds arent good but it rolled in and felt great q how did you feel out there today the way you prepared the last few day for this u open compared to some other first round at u open the way you normally prepare phil mickelson you never know whats going to happen the week of the tournament so youve got to prepare for all element

entering the profession now a few will truck right along i know others will discover that the career track in the ministry is in the process of exploding all of this mean that you and iministers congregation seminary individual laypeopleneed to start thinking creatively about bivocational ministry at the seminary level it might make sense to partner with a community college or trade school at the congregational level it might make sense to adjust to the fact that your pastor may not be a suit for much longer for individual minister and seminarian it would be a good idea to get down learning different skill set people should take this up this early on before they get old like me sowe need to think broadly about what those skill set might be right now most seminary can train you up to simultaneously be a minister andwork in another kind of nonprofit these dualdegree program work best when someone is in fact called to both discipline also they reflect a bias toward the oldschool profession that isnt helpful the problem for many of u is that we arent interested in other traditional profession i looked at similar field and chose the ministry because it fit my skill set and enabled me to do the thing i like more than the thing i didnt so why would i want my other job to be something that is kinda like the ministry but not a fulfilling for me what should happen instead is that we seek out this new vocation the way we sought out the old one what are we called to do where can we continue to give to world while our spirit simultaneously get filled if my church said they didnt need me full time i would probably attempt being a buskerbrewmasterukulelemakerbaker then i would narrow it down none of these are taught in seminary all of them take time to perfect all of them cost money to get started and a while to build up a customer base yes even busker but i would love the work just like i love the ministry anyway those are my thought for the day the fact is pretty much any minister born today will have to be part time at some point and probably for an extended time if we think of the way this is a good thing then perhaps we will have more creative and energized ministry in the future here are some link this one is to a recent peacebang essay about some of the stress on our congregation here is a link to the book we are reading for our parish committee retreat which discus asking the right question a we enter the unknown posted by reveliot at am email thisblogthisshare to twittershare to facebookshare to pinterest label church life reflection spending money comment adam gonnerman may at am when i wa a young ministry student in an evangelical tradition i decided to be bivocational specifically i intended to go to brazil doing mission work and i would be partially supported by church in the u with the remainder being made up from earnings teaching english a a foreign language unfortunately i received no guidance in preparing for this future and i had a few detractor one person told me flatly that will never work it didnt work but not because it wa a bad idea the difficulty wa that in brazil people want to study english either early in the morning or after work in the evening this left the middle part of my day free for family and church work yet since the church gathering during the week were all in the evening of course this mean that i only saw group of people from the church on the weekend also it wa exhausting i left fulltime ministry year ago and am currently a project manager working in tech im now an organizer with sunday assembly nyc and intend to become a humanist celebrant later this year in the future i see myself pursuing uua ministry though i suspect my ministry will be nontraditional and largely focused outside the local parish at least until retirement age in short im willing to give bivocational ministry a try anyone who is going to do it though need to think it through long and

spectator guide history usga member clubhouse shop virtual u open back to interview phil mickelson thursday nbc thursday june q how wa the red eye last night phil mickelson it wa good i loved having an early tee time i wish we didnt have the rain delay because it made for a little bit longer day but the golf course is playing about a easy a it could and yet merion is really fighting hard we were having a hard time scoring low here it so demanding it such a great track it one of the best ive seen for a u open and we had soft condition and still were all having a hard time getting under par q let get you out to the golf course and show you some of those highlight you bogeyed your first hole but here you are getting back to even phil mickelson it wa a little lefttoright i actually hit l wedge and the tee wa up that wa a big putt because i putted my first hole q you parred the next five and then birdie here at phil mickelson that wa tough one because it wa quick you can see that i tried to have it last a long a possible and it just died in the lip so i read that well and didnt hit a great second shot to give myself a great putt at it but i wa able to make it q you talk about par save keeping the round together how about this phil mickelson it wa critical i wa fortunate to have a decent lie and to have enough green where i could get the ball stopped and i hit a good shot q third at six just a good a that one there phil mickelson well i wa actually trying to fly it further or farther and it came up short and wa it released down i thought if i flew it closer to the hole i might be able to stop it a little bit better but i left myself a nice uphill look at it q bunker is never easy and that wa excellent par save there your second at to set up another birdie phil mickelson this wa my best shot of the day it wa a little iron you cant go two yard long or youre going to have a hard par and i flew it exactly where i wanted to and it ended up with a tap in that wa a good one q not a lot of people are going to birdie this week and you did today phil mickelson it because i made a putt it not like im trying to get that ball close i hit iron to the middle and it wa uphill lefttoright it wa a good a putt from foot a i could have the odds arent good but it rolled in and felt great q how did you feel out there today the way you prepared the last few day for this u open compared to some other first round at u open the way you normally prepare phil mickelson you never know whats going to happen the week of the tournament so youve got to prepare for all element prior and when i wa here for the few day beforehand the week before i wa able to get all the work done that i needed and then the last part heading into today round wa to get my game sharp to get my

many time what do you think that say about his resiliency matt kuchar he a fantastic player it show that just his career record on the pga tour i dont know how many something win or something like that it just he a great player and you figure he going to get one sooner or later q winning or not winning a u open doesnt define phil mickelson is what youre saying matt kuchar you got to ask phil q would you welcome a championship coming back here at merion matt kuchar yeah it awesome i hope sooner the better q it been five year since tiger won a major can you talk about that matt kuchar it a good question i dont know there still a lot of time left i think what wa hogan won how many after how many did hogan win after the age of so it still doable q where would you rank this golf course a far a toughness is concerned matt kuchar one of the top for sure no question q what make it so tough matt kuchar nobody can break par q no microphone matt kuchar i dont think any worse i definitely dont work any worse q no microphone matt kuchar at first i thought i might go see philly but there were a lot of late night and unfortunately i wasnt able to make it down fastscripts by asap sport

inadequate waste management transport system management of water and wastewater city lighting energetics spatial planning describes politics over longer period of time and defines the way of city development within certain time period spatial planning should be maintained by consensus of public citizenship urban planning profession politics and economics of development ambition spatial planning should be a framework of finding new entrepreneurial project and not a the case is now within majority of local and regional selfgovernment in croatia where spatial plan are adapting to need and interest of investor there is a need for integrated waste management system implementation especially in regard to waste disposal zagreb is currently experiencing over of water loss big part of zagreb is situated within water protection area therefore it is not simple to plan and realize many project it is necessary to raise the quality of public transportation through usage of environmentally friendly transport vehicle usage of electricity from renewable energy source biogas and biodiesel usage there are good precondition for suburban railway revitalization there is a possibility for many saving within city lighting through realization of energy efficiency project in regard to public and city light by replacing classical light bulb with energy efficient light fixture and replacement of lamp casing which is also an obligation according to the law on light pollution there is a possibility of heat cost allocator for district heating in order to protect

moreover we wanted to prove that our synporter protein is exported into the periplasm our general induction experiment showed that the gene of both of our histagged synporter protein torabtuf and toraglms were expressed successfully in r planticola and s blattae examining the fraction of our cell periplasm speroplasts and cytoplasm our synporter protein were detected outside of the cytoplasm our torabtuf synporter protein ha a calculated molecular weight of kda and contains a polyhistidinetag so we expected a protein band on the western blot in the area of the kda mark which wa detected our toraglms synporter protein ha a calculated molecular weight of kda and contains a polyhistidinetag so we expected a protein band on the western blot in the area obetween the kda mark and the kda mark which wa also detected fig western blot with different cellular fraction western blot analysis wa performed with the periplasma fraction and the spheroplast fraction and the disrupted periplasma a control function finally we wanted to prove that the counterpart of our synporter protein the vitamin b wa also exported into the periplasm therefore we let our organism produce vitamin b fractionated our cell a described above and performed a photometric b assay compared to empty plasmid control we could detect significantly higher amount of vitamin b in the cytoplasm a also in the periplasm when the synporter protein were expressed fig this increased production is mainly due to the fact that the cell have to compensate for the b leaving the cytoplasm bound to the synporter fig final result of the photometric assay the plot show the quantity of b per amount of protein in the periplasmic fraction and the cytoplasmic fraction contact facebook twitter email homepage address

two european championship and a world cup with poland national teambut on this january afternoon blaszczykowski wa a long way from those moment instead he wa about to play his first exhibition game since rejoining wisla krakow one of poland most decorated team wisla is the club blaszczykowski made his name with and the team he had promised to someday return to when he signed with dortmund in he wa not returning to ease into retirement though or for a final payday in fact the opposite wa true blaszczykowski known a kuba had come home in an unusual deal in which he agreed to take virtually no money to play and to join with two polish investor to lend the club million zloty about to cover his new teammate unpaid wagesthe wisla krakow he rejoined he knew wa in dire strait it proud history besmirched after a series of disastrous event involving a hooligan takeover missing money and a mysterious foreign investor who offered himself a a savior collected the club ownership certificate and then without producing even a single zloty disappearedwisla krakow problem were year in the making but they started to accelerate in when the team longtime owner boguslaw cupial decided to sell the clubcupial had been one of poland postcommunist success story earning million through his cable company telefonika in he invested some of his fortune in wisla transforming the club into an eighttime league champion under his stewardship but cupial took a big hit in the global financial crisis and in sold the moneylosing club to a local buyerthat buyer promptly flipped the club to t wisla a supporterfriendly umbrella organization that already controlled wisla krakow other sport team the businessman it turned out had no money said michal trela a reporter for przeglad sportowy a polish sport daily after one month trela said the supporter bought the club back for zloty around centsin an age of superrich foreign owner in soccer a sale that actually gave fan a say in the running of their club should have been refreshing but at wisla the purchase appeared to hand control to a group of soccer hooligan called the sharksalmost every club in poland ha a problem with hooligan said szymon jadczak an investigative reporter for the polish television network tvn but in wisla the hooligan were the clubthe shark have a loud intimidating presence at wislas stadium and in a group of them made headline when they were photographed giving the nazi salute while in rome to watch rom play lazio now they were calling the shot at wisla krakow under the leadership of pawel michalski who had served more than six year in prison for throwing a knife from the stand at an italian player during a uefa cup match through t wisla michalski wa able to ensure that two people with close connection to the shark were put in charge of the club and contract for everything from cleaning the stadium to printing the matchday program were signed with friend and associate at what were viewed a inflated rate the club jadczak said became a sort of cash machine for people connected to the shark leadershipwhen question were raised the wisla president installed after the shark takeover marzena sarapata held a news conference to dismiss the claim that the hooligan group effectively controlled the club but a few month later an arrest warrant wa issued for michalski whom the police charged with heading a criminal group and with having involvement in the drug trade shortly afterward poland central bureau of investigation undertook a series of raid in which they arrested dozen of hooligan michalski left polandjadczaks televised investigation about the takeover and mismanagement at wisla broadcast by tvn in september wa the last straw the club top official resigned and the city of krakow persuaded poland soccer authority to send any money owed to the club to the city instead to cover unpaid rent at a cityowned stadium michalski wa eventually arrested in italy he will stand trial later this year sarapata did not respond to phone call or message from the new york time but did give an interview to a website owned by the same polish betting company that sponsor wisla and denied all the allegation meanwhile the video clip of hooligan being arrested and of search at t wislas headquarters made finding a new investor for the club difficult and the unpaid player merely fell into line with the other debtor wisla needed a saviorin december it thought it had found one a frenchcambodian businessman named vanna ly who claimed to have extensive investment in soccer club around the world announced he would be purchasing percent of wisla krakow the rest would be owned by noble capital partner a british investment firm represented by a swedish businessman mat hartling

manchester united even ha finally joined the fray it launched it woman team in the secondtier championship last year and immediately set about recruiting an allstar rosterthe effect ha been seismic not just in term of result manchester city reached the champion league semifinal the last two season and england national team finished third in the woman world cup but in term of interest too more than people attended last season woman fa cup final and two million more watched it live on televisionlittle or none of that growth though ha found it way to doncaster or more accurately rossington a

ha arguably done more for woman soccer in england than any other a club that wa synonymous with the sport for decade in the s and early s long before the professional club showed any interest in woman soccer the belle were it preeminent forcebetween and the belle reached of woman fa cup final and won the trophy six time the team won the first ever woman national league title in and regained the crown in it would finish a runnersup seven time in the following yearsback then it player formed the backbone of the english national team at one point we had seven or eight player in the squad said gillian coultard who spent year playing for the belle in the team heyday and picked up appearance for england for a long time she wa one of five player to have made a century of appearance for her country the others were bobby moore bobby charlton peter shilton and billy wright it wa a good quiz question she saiddoncaster of course wa proud of the belle a small tightknit town on the edge of the south yorkshire coalfield it is not a place that attracts much national attention or frequently enjoys much sporting success the belle changed that we won so much coultard said the cup final were on television we felt like we represented doncaster and south yorkshire we kept the town at the pinnacleedmunds remembers the club being asked to send representative to have afternoon tea with the queen and prince philip when they visited doncaster the player were guest of honor at the town mansion house the ornate georgian home of the local authority on several occasionswe never had any sexist stuff she said south yorkshire people arent like that it the sort of place where they acknowledge what people can do they get behind you there wa a real pride at what we achievedthere wa broader cultural recognition too the writer pete davy spent a year with the team in the early s his subsequent book i lost my heart to the belle coupled with the club success made the name famous the playwright kay mellor used the book a source material for playing the field a bbc drama that ran for five season in the sto many at a time when woman soccer received scant investment and commanded little attention the belle were the sport most prominent face they were the epitome of woman football said mike blackham like most of the people who go to watch the belle now blackham and his wife jane have a personal connection to the club a friend play for the first teamthat is testament to how the club horizon have retracted in recent year a the fortune of woman soccer have risen those of the belle have ebbed the woman game ha changed edmunds said it is more financially driven we have been left behind a little bitin when the football association the sport governing body in britain expanded the woman super league to two division doncaster belle were demoted to the second tier and manchester city woman team far younger but crucially aligned with a premier league behemoth were promoted in their stead vic akers then the manager of arsenal lady described the decision a morally scandalousdoncaster wa promoted back to the top flight in but lasted only a season before being relegated again it won the second division last year it first trophy since but did not take up it place in the top tier the fa had changed the licensing criterion and the belle lacking a headline sponsor and a major men team to bankroll the club could not meet the new requirement financially we could not do it edmunds saidall but two member of the championshipwinning side departed many for manchester uniteds new woman team neil redfearn the manager left for liverpool the belle decided against using the keepmoat stadium the neat modern venue that is home to doncaster rover the men team with which they have a mostly symbolic alliance and set up instead in rossington where the two stand are little more than a few step covered by a roof smaller surroundings edmunds said would not be a daunting for the young player that now comprised the teamin doncaster the belle fame endures and so doe the affection and esteem in which they are held edmunds for example is wellknown enough in the town that a few year ago when she wa awarded an honor in london for her contribution to sport the local paper afforded her the ultimate accolade it referred to her by only her first nameblackham who coach a local junior team find that while young boy dream of premier league stardom the girl tend to have a different ambition they dont talk about playing for manchester city or chelsea or arsenal he said they want to play for the bellesthere is some regret at the club diminished status the demise of it is very sad because it wa so unique said coultard but there is no resentment of the game authority no lingering anger at the football association for failing to curate the most famous woman team of all that era ha gone edmunds said we do not want people to forget that history because so many people put so much into it but we do not dwell on itinstead she said she take satisfaction in seeing all of the player who came through the club rank who have gone on to play professionally to play in europe to play for their

ontrend gray from an upscale catalog with a name like elephant breath or slipper satin the club came and did it demirci said he glanced upward to the other minor alteration to the shop he owned until a few week ago a bright white sign but i installed that myselfon the other side of the road the change ha been rather more drastic the window seat at the lilywhites sandwich bar now offer a view of the gleaming glass frontage of the billion stateoftheart stadium that starting wednesday evening when it host it inaugural premier league game tottenham hotspur will call homethe territory is of course familiar the new stadium is on the same patch of land a the atmospheric historic old white hart lane where spur played for year the horizon though is different the club hope the new stadium represents not just a great leap forward for spur proof in concrete and steel that this team belongs among europe preeminent power but for english soccer a a wholechris lee it chief architect said he had looked at some stadium around the world for inspiration and incorporated the best element he could find into what he labeled the best stadium on the planet an arena supposed to be more modern than wembley sleeker than old trafford bigger crucially than arsenal home at the emirate it is supposed to set what daniel levy the spur chairman described a a new standard for sport stadiumsthe arena centerpiece is the biggest singletier stand in england capable of holding fan modeled on borussia dortmund südtribune known more commonly a the yellow wall it claim to be home to the longest bar in europe it ha a retractable field allowing it to host not only premier league match but nfl game too it ha it own microbrewery and a restaurant run by a michelinstarred chef and in what is surely a first for a soccer team spur will have it own onsite sommelierthe appeal for levy and the club of course is the financial boost all of that can bring more fan spending more time and more money all of it flowing straight into the team coffer levy said tuesday that with the extra revenue generated by the stadium spur income would be in the world top this is a team that ha long had to wheel and deal in the transfer market on sunday the club manager mauricio pochettino admitted he and his staff had laughed at the sight of naby keita and fabinho million worth of talent combined on liverpool bench when the team met representing a luxury way beyond spur mean tottenhams new home is in time supposed to change that to turn spur into a club that can compete with the elite not just on the field but off itthe effect of the stadium though will resonate beyond spur balance sheet the club ha long claimed it can be a catalyst for the regeneration of the neighborhood around it at a news medium presentation on tuesday the club executive director donna cullen opened with a photograph of a burning car a reminder of the riot that scarred the area before spreading across the capital and the country in that hot angry summer cullen said wa the trigger for spur to think about what it could do to improve not only it own horizon but those of the place it represents the area around tottenham haringey is the fifthmost deprived borough in london she said the club wa taken over by a spirit of let see what we can dothe local authority haringay council doe not entirely accept the idea that tottenhams rebirth rest on the stadium charles adje the councilor responsible for regeneration said he would not use the word catalyst himself but he acknowledged that it add value to the areaboth the club and the council project that the new stadium could pour around million a year into the local economy spur estimated that it would be responsible for more than job this stadium and this new club is going to make a massive massive difference to the people of tottenham david lammy tottenhams member of parliament said this weekthat too will take time of course so far the main visible difference to tottenham high road are the new facade on the sandwich bar the convenience store and a handful of other property across from the stadium the street running to and from it are otherwise much the same a always a jumble of jerk chicken place and nail bar polish supermarket and tumbledown mechanicssmoking a cigarette outside the barbershop he ha run for year inan gulecyuz said he wa happy to wait the stadium opening is technically bad news for him business drop on game day he said and with soccer and the nfl to fit in he will lose a little tradethat will he hope be offset by the benefit it will bring they have changed a lot of the shop just up the road he said hopefully the same thing will happen down the road tooa little further from the stadium irfan sahin wa serving coffee in fieldseat his delicatessen café bookshop and organic food market soft classical music played overheadsahin said that he expected the stadium to alter the character of the area to encourage more business to open there is no other michelinstarred restaurant in north london he noted but then he said tottenham is changing anyway in london gentrification is a constant tide regardless of where soccer club playit is very different from when i first came here in he said it is slow of course we had two gang fight right outside in the last year or so but there are more place opening all of the time bar and pub and cafés and restaurant it is not a expensive a central london or a expensive a east london so it is a good place to open hopefully it will be better with the stadiumacademic literature is unclear on whether that will hold true writing in the journal of economic perspective in john siegfried and andrew zimbalist concluded based largely on case study in the united state that while team owner have argued that sport facility boost local economic activity economic reasoning and empirical evidence suggest the oppositethere are those in tottenham certainly who feel disenfranchised by the speed of change and by redevelopment proposal backed by the council and the club there is a real risk of company going out of business if we can not find alternative location in the neighborhood said feruk tepeyurt the owner of a local joinery firm and chairman of the peacock industrial estate home to more than small business but under both the council plan and a separate project proposed by the club scheduled to become a park do we need a park or do we need a community of small business a lot of them run by local black and minority ethnic peoplethat is the tension inherent in any regeneration of course the issue of who precisely it is supposed to work for of whose need it is meeting there is a thin dividing line between seeing the stadium a a catalyst for regeneration and a trojan horse for social cleansing said mark panton an academic at birkbeck college who ha written extensively on the disputethere is one change left to come transport for london the capital transit authority is expected to accept a proposal to rename white hart lane the nearest train station to the stadium to tottenham hotspurit is not unprecedented arsenal ha had it own tube stop dating to the s but nor is it universally popular the objection is based on the idea that erasing the station name wipe clean a century or so of history that it needlessly hamfistedly conflates the identity of tottenham the area and tottenham the team that it creates the impression deep down below the fresh coat of paint that the place exists to serve the club rather than the club existing

german club fascination with young english talent but in reality he wa the end result a consequence rather than a cause of a trend that date way beyond one that explains why exactly all of those bundesliga scout were watching that under game in pulaabout year ago we decided that young player had to be our focus a a club said max eberl mönchengladbachs sporting director we had no financial potential to do anything else we had to create money and value a different waythat meant keeping tab on the best young talent not just in germany but across europe mönchengladbachs scout started watching national youth team a shortcut to establishing which player were regarded a the best in their homeland and a chance to compare them directly with the talent on the rise in germanythe initial emphasis eberl explained wa on france belgium and holland traditionally fertile breeding ground a well a market like denmark where his club had strong link england wa not a market we had focused on he said but it did not take long to realize that there were a lot of top player in england agegroup teamseberl dispatched scout not to watch the premier league but to game between club under and under
