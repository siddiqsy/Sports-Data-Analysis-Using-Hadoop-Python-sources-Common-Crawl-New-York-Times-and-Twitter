my wide variety of hue by the end of one week i had drawn what i must say wa a very elegant dolphin with bold black outline and a deep aqua shadei remember the ride home vividly carefully admiring my work i noticed that the paper wa still sodden with my aggressivelyapplied ink that couldnt do i prudently rolled down my window and stuck my portrait out into the windfor a while the dolphin flapped nobly sending ticklish vibration up my arm i laughed at the amusement we rushed over a small bridge the dolphin flailed wildly sharply whipped back and forth back and forth audibly crackling in the wind and then she wa freei did not even see it land despite my plea mother would not pull over ive always assumed since then that my dolphin drifted down slowly gently over the rail of the bridge into that gurgling brook i frequently think about where it could be now there part of me that belief it still there patiently tucked under some stone waiting for me andrew ni princeton njdefinitely the most memorable thing ive lost wa my glass i remember i had taken them off to take a shower a one doe and afterwards when i left the bathroom i forgot to get them eventually i realized i left them and went looking but when i got to the bathroom they werent there after about day of searching every nook and cranny in my house i decided to just give up we even had to move which is when i figured id

end of the line in my cafeteria at school and when it is not there i am sad jason s philadelphia pa mastermanmy obsession with the cheese steak began when i wa but a wee lad and had not experienced much in my short life up until that point that day when i wa four year old my life changed and my appetite became fixated on the sandwich sure i would eat other thing but i knew that there wa only one item that could satiate my truest craving i tried all kind of topping pepper hot pepper the list went on but i realized that only one combination of ingredient could ever be the same a that first lifealtering bite that list being a cheese steak with solely meat cheese whiz and onion jonah a masterman schooli think it all started when i wa four or five and my mom and i were eating at a diner in new york i usually ate egg and bacon while my mom ate my leftover since i wa small and the plate wa huge but this time my mom ordered a greek salad she told me to try some because it wa very healthy but i did not like the look of all the different shape in the plate i settled for a round light green object with seed in the middle because we had just learned how to plant seed at my school when i tried it i immediately fell in love with the cucumber i ate every single one off the greek salad and completely forgot about my bacon when i wa year old i wa already perfecting the different way to cut the skin of the cucumber and how to make different shape with the cucumber at year old i would sometimes eat three cucumber a day during the summer tino k masterman philadelphiaxiao long bao consist of a ball of meat usually pork or crab or both and broth inside a dumpling skin you have to eat a xiao long bao carefully a you can puncture the skin easily and all of the broth will seep out i eat xiao long bao with chopstick and a chinese spoon you carefully grab the top of the dumpling with your chopstick then put the dumpling on your spoon over a bowl in case you accidentally puncture it then you bite the top of the dumpling off in order to let it cool down after that depending on it temperature you can just eat the entire thing or eat it in smaller bite i love xiao long bao and often try to beat my record of in one sitting nicolas dorazio jr masterman school philadelphia paa food i loved since my childhood is a sacred ritual every year at chinese new year this food to my family is so important that if you dont include it on your dinner list you must pay all guest dollar and that dish is dumpling drizzled in chili oil eric li masterman philadelphiathere is this certain food that i love but it not necessarily my favorite food it a very uncommon food item that im always craving it is horseradish cheese it like normal cheddar cheese but with a little radish kick in it it caught me and my dad eye once at our local supermarket and we though hmm might a well try it we bought it and when we got home we cut slice for each of u to get a taste it wa amazing simon rathmann julian r masterman schoolthe food we loathei hate mushroom straight and simple mushroom and i have never ever gotten along first of all it is a fungus and who would want to eat a fungus they grow from warm moist place that are usually rotten and most of the time they stink not only that but when you eat them they have this weird mushy texture that will make you want to barf mushroom are the villain of food they dont add flavor to your meal instead they suck the life out of it paige phillips hoggard high school wilmington nci hate shellfish like clam and muscle it just taste like seawater and sadness who like the taste of seawater liam s masterman philadelphiaone of my all time least favorite food is olive i really despise everything about them to their taste and even their look they just look like something straight out of a scifi movie and when i first tasted one i threw up i cant even get started on the red thing inside the green olive a a kid i thought it wa like the blood of the olive or something weird so i just never touched one even when someone ate an olive near me it made me cringe just by the sound of it when you eat it abdoul diallo julia r masterman philadelphiai have an extreme hatred for anything artificially orange flavored this stem from when i got a sinus infection at the age of and wa required to take amoxicillin an orangeflavored liquid medicine i had to take about tablespoon twice a day for two week and let me tell you it wa one of the most horrific and torturous experience of my life the second it touched my tongue i gagged and thought i wa actually going to throw up sivan frankel masterman school philadelphia pafish egg i hate everything about them from the texture to the taste and just thinking about eating them is enough to make me feel like vomiting i have eaten three type of fish egg before including ikura red caviar and mentaiko cod roe but the most disgusting way i have eaten fish egg before is by eating a fried shishamo a type of small fish and not knowing that they are fried while they still have egg inside of them i had never liked shishamo and taking a bite out of one and noticing hundred of small white egg spill out just made me despise those fried fish even more kaya perelman masterman philadelphiaid like to have a conversation with someone who like vinegar just so i can ask them what the appeal is zephyr spatz philadelphia mastermanevery type of chocolate white chocolate dark chocolate and milk chocolate it is all disgusting part of the reason i hate it so much is because of my sister when we were younger it wa all she ate every meal wa chocolate she loved it so much i just never wanted to eat it i tried it before and did not like it so when she ate so much chocolate it made me not want to eat it because i did not want to do anything she did after that i never tried it again and to this day i still hate chocolate and it still make me sick jonnah berger masterman philadelphia pai personally have a burning hatred of beet not like music beat but rather the vegetable with the highest sugar content in it class when i first tried beet i thought that they had gone bad because my mother had described them a sweet and really good but i only tasted a ripe sickening taste i of course then yelled ewwwwww then my mom ran over and asked what the fuss wa and i responded with something along the line of you gave me one that went bad it all squishy and gross she then picked up my fork and to a bite for herself she said that it didnt go bad and that this wa just how it tasted ian birley masterman philadelphiaone food that i now despise would have to be borscht soup it is made of potato onion carrot and most importantly beet when i wa younger i would eat borscht or want to eat borscht every single day in fact i used to refuse to eat soup that wasnt the color red what happened is the question that i now ask myself since i can not even look at the soup without gagging i think that it is the combination of soggy wet carrot and the slippery disgusting onion that i cant stand other russian or belarussians ukrainian find it so strange that i dont like a traditional russian dish but i dont care i just cant bring myself to eat it hanna sh jr masterman philadelphia paliving on the edgewhile this isnt really an obsession whenever i see a food that ha milk im compelled to eat it the only problem is that im allergic to all dairy product ever since the age of i wa careful not to eat anything with milk i would meticulously read over food label and if i wa slightly suspicious of whether or not the food product had milk i would not eat it that all changed when i wa when i wa i started to feel rebellious i wanted to live on the edge and while eating something youre allergic isnt exactly the peak of living on the edge it wa for me i wa the kid who wa scared of taking risk and here i wa the first dairy product i knowingly tried wa sour cream and onion chip i ate the whole bag and while my lip felt tingly and my throat hurt my adrenaline wa through the roof i felt ecstatic it made me feel on edge and to this day eating dairy is the closest i will be to feeling energizedever since then if i see food that contains milk i try to eat it whether it is swiping cheez it from my friend or eating pizza before a concert i dont even like the taste of dairy product cheese disgust me and chocolate make me feel sick at this point the compulsion to eat dairy override any common sense i have left the only reason i dont eat any and all dairy around me is because my friend are worried that this compulsion to eat dairy is going to kill me one day which is totally fair ami s masterman philadelphiawhen i wa younger i really liked thing that had hazelnut in them like nutella and ferrero rocher i also just liked snacking on hazelnut by themselves in general when i realized i had obtained an allergy to them i wa absolutely devastated hazelnut were my childhood and it wa like part of my innocent childish memory were stripped away from me i wa always wondering what hazelnut tasted like because over year i forgot what it tasted likeone day i just decided to eat it whats the worst that could happen i mean sure i could go to the hospital and be in excruciating pain but i want to relive my childhood i took a small spoonful of nutella spread it on a small cracker sucked air into my stomach and ate it all my memory came flooding back from this food i loved so deeply it wa like i wa in a state of euphoria until my sens hit me like a rock and suffered the consequence of the food it wa so bad i almost passed out and went to the hospital it wa a crazy experience and i dont regret any bit of it kate chin masterman philadelphia pa__________on feb le than a minute into a nationally televised game against archrival north carolina duke zion williamson injured his right knee when one of his nike sneaker exploded the incident revived question about whether shoe company should be able to pay to have player exclusively wear their gear and whether college athlete should get a cut of the profit we posed these question to student in this student opinion questionthe response were split down the middle with student on both side of the debate arguing their case persuasively we chose the comment below because they used a compelling combination of logic ethic emotion statistic and even united state law to support their claimsno college athlete should not be paidi think they really already are getting paid when we talk about college athlete getting paid were usually talking about the best of the best the one who have full scholarship to their college many time these college would cost in the ten of thousand some even in the hundred thousand but college athlete dont need to pay anything they are given access to some of the best facility in the world and sometimes even better than professional sport team with these facility these player can push themselves to their limit and become the best version of themselvesif you bring actual money into college sport it will change it forever it will change the dynamic of the whole sport many player love being in college and if they choose the right college and coach they will always be welcomed back and a second home not only are the player given the facility to develop into great athlete but if they choose a great coach the coach will mold them into great young men who are fit for anything at clemson university there is an emphasis on this dabo swinney the head coach for the football team only recruit athlete that he find fitting for the program the whole vibe at clemson is a very good vibe and many player build bond that will last forever in all the college experience is a great one and it really isnt the college experience after player are paid it just becomes another division of professional sport brian ssis hcmc vietnamcollege sport are only to represent your college and make them proud if they want money and the sport department is not giving it then let them not participate i am sure the team is not going to lose out usually in sport there are a lot of people who try out so it is easy to find a replacement for him moreover all the sport get you good fame and a good personality aadesh ssis hcmc vietnamcollege sport are a preparation for professional sport this drive many athlete to attain college level skill they use the more competitive game and intense training to get a feel for a higher level tracy argues that too many organization reap billion of dollar from the effort and talent of preprofessional athlete yes their game are televised but this doesnt just bring profit to company and college it publicizes player and give them an opportunity to be scouted by professional coach zoe lee hoggard wilmington nci feel a a student athlete your attending school not only to play sport but to also obtain good education to succeed in life when your playing a sport for a school your basically representing your school for whatever sport your playing while playing for the school the coordinator for the sport and other volunteer put in a lot of money to make sure you have the essential you need in order to play college athlete are provided with so much stuff that they dont really need to worry about money they are well taken cared of ice tresvik john t hoggard highat first i believed that college athlete should be paid because they work a hard and are a good a professional provide a source of entertainment and sell million of ticket per game they play however after reading through the comment section ive changed my mind the whole point of college is to get a good education and to use that education in the future to help them guide their way to their career however if they start getting paid they will focus on money and not their education that can result in a decrease of interest in education and grade of college player will also decrease leading to the chance of being a pro athlete decreasing a well furthermore if college athlete get paid the pay will most likely be different for each player and that will create a competitive atmosphere among the same team of athlete if college athlete get paid the pay of each player will be what defines them instead of their skill therefore i think that college athlete shouldnt be paid soyoung ssis hcmc vietnamyes college athlete deserve a cut of the profitsin my opinion i do believe college athlete should be paid or at least be able to get some type of income these athlete are bringing in over billion dollar a year including tv broadcasting ticket and even sponsor also the ncaa prohibits these athlete from getting a job or receiving any type of income and some of these athlete dont come from high rich family and they dont receive a full ride so they dont know how to pay for the rest of their tuitionin the case of zion williamson he should for sure be paid the game between duke and unc did not come cheap the average price for the game wa a little over nine thousand and cheapest price wa a little under three thousand that is what most call the zion effect tayo ojo everman high schoolpeople always say that college athlete should be thankful that they get a scholarship but scholarship arent enough degree are useless to athlete they often dont get meaningful degree they dont connection when it come to job and they arent allowed to get internship because of ncaa rule student also cant work during the season most of them dont care about their subject i dont blame them because they have to balance sport and class and their schedule sound like a nightmare they arent guided on life outside of sport if these student get a job outside of sport theyre going to have a hard time competing in the job marketthe athlete should get paid so they have something to fall back on if they dont become professional athlete which ha le than a chance of happening even if college wa useful only of athlete get enough grant and scholarship to cover the full cost of college ncaa doesnt even compensate for player injury there are injury for every and there were injury from to player can lose scholarship if they get injured the word studentathlete wa created in the s to avoid worker compensation ami s masterman philadelphiaat first glance the prospect of paying college student a salary on top of their scholarship seems ridiculous however when you look closer and on a case to case basis it becomes more ridiculous to ignore the evidence that point to the contrary for college athlete at this level of competition they have had to train and devote their entire life to becoming the physical specimen needed to play division one athletics with this kind of commitment to excellence often come a disregard for other thing if these student are spending more of their time becoming athlete than studying and learning they will not be well suited for the world after sport therefore by using these student talent to make money for the ncaa and not compensating these player they are not only stealing from them but compromising their future forever ezra lombarditickets for the duke v carolina game were being sold for upwards of dollar and i can personally guarantee that athlete like zion williamson did not see a penny of this money ironically without athlete these event would not be possible although college athlete receive prestigious scholarship they are minuscule compared to the amount college brand and the ncaa make from one game alone i believe college athlete should receive a percentage of the money that is made from event they participate in game they play and use of their imageeven though college athlete are paid in fame training and scholarship there are also definite risk and drawback injury is a constant risk that could potentially end the career of any athlete at any time zion williamson is a perfect example of this if his injury had been worse his career could have been ended and any athletic scholarship would be revoked erin johnston hoggard high school wilmington ncthey should be paid but howpeople have brought up the point that scholarship arent enough and that since the ncaa and the college make so much money off of some of these game then player should be paid for them but if player were played for these game then how much would they be paid would all athlete be paid the same amount or would they be paid off based on the amount of ticket they sell for their gamesi think all athlete being paid a fixed amount for each game would be a good way for them to be able to keep playing their sport a well being able to have money to survive in college but i feel like if a system like this wa put in place then there would be outrage people would say that athlete should be paid based on the amount of ticket their game sell but is that really fair obviously college football and basketball will sell the most ticket by far and then player on those team would get paid more but some sport like track and baseball would not sell anywhere near a much ticket and then there player would be paid lessi think that if this system is put in place there would be outrage and it would lead to more debate on the ncaa system because then bench player who rarely see playing time would be paid more than star in other sport i think that a way to resolve the pay issue would be to let student athlete get other job paul n nhrhs njstudentathletes are being exploited by school the ncaa and shoe companiesi believe studentathletes should be paid something in addition to scholarship and grant even if it is minimal big corporation take all the money from the athlete for example nike get to showcase their jersey and shoe every single national televised game meanwhile zion is not getting anything every williamson jersey that is sold isnt giving money to zion it is all going toward nike if college athlete were allowed to sign with a shoe brand zion would definitely have it own brand overall the ncaa and other company are taking advantage of studentathletes and these athlete should be getting paid something michael h nhrhscompanies like nike and the ncaa turn collage player into walking ad and yet these player get nothing it like if you didnt pay to put ad on billboard but those billboard were self dependent living thing who needed to somehow pay for food and a decent living space while also taking class and having billboard practice every day after those class and one single scrape on that billboard could mean the end of it carrier except it not a career because they dont get paid i cant put myself in zion williamsons shoe because im not in his situation and i in no way know all the fact but i do believe he would be justified in sitting out the rest of the college season because at the end of the day he should be more concerned for his own prosperity then the prosperity of the executive that run the ncaa henry scott jr masterman philadelphia paye if you use an athlete likeness they should be compensated fairly if zion jersey are sold in bookstore regardless of whether his last name is on the jersey and theyre using his commercial image to sell tix he should be compensated for a percentage of those sale nick bostonadvertisement
advertisementsupported byon college basketballby marc tracyif the opinion published friday night in a landmark college sport antitrust case were a novel then it villain would be the ncaain a novellalength page opinion united state district court judge claudia wilken criticizes berates even mock the ncaa for it refusal to allow college to compensate player for their valuable labor beyond a scholarship and related cost of attendance all in the name of something they call amateurismdefendants nowhere define the nature of the amateurism they claim consumer insist upon said wilken referring to the ncaa and several of it richest most prominent conferenceseven if they had wilken continued she pointed to numerous exception when player could effectively be paid player are paid beyond scholarship all the time in untold million of dollar invested in training facility in gift for participating in bowl game in fund available to purchase lossofvalue insurancethe rule that permit limit or forbid studentathlete compensation and benefit do not follow any coherent definition of amateurism she saidthe decision stem from a longrunning case in which a group of college athlete sued the ncaa and athletic conference that participate in the top level of basketball and football they contended that the ruling body of college sport had colluded to enact a system that unfairly limit the compensation they receive when they are attending and competing for their university the ncaa and the conference argue that those limit are essential for promoting amateurism and enhancing the value of college sport and undergraduate educationin her decision wilken seems to say that those rule did restrain trade producing significant anticompetitive effectsthe clerk wilken added on the final page with the majestic understatement of a good literary denouement shall enter judgment for the plaintiff classso why doesnt it feel a if the group of athlete who pursued the litigation to end the ncaas rule won the case why did they and their star sport labor lawyer jeffrey kessler not get the outcome they most fervently soughtdespite finding that the ncaa wa violating federal law wilken turned away the plaintiff main proposed remedy which wa also the logical one to lift the supposedly lawbreaking cap on compensation that mean the continuation of a status quo where so many player feel they are working basically for free hows thatwhen you apply a uniquely muddled set of law to a unique industry this is the kind of ruling you get said gabe feldman who directs tulanes sport law program and teach antitrust law the unique muddle to which he wa referringthe upshot of friday ruling pending a likely appeal is that the ncaa may continue to cap payment to athlete after all with the limited exception of expense that are educational in nature think computer or cost related to internship or postgraduate scholarshipsdont think stipend of or or because the player receiving it is good enough that he or she is worth even more than that to the college in increased ticket sale and medium exposure and television right paymentsno wonder several of the defendant responded this weekend with the kind of equanimity one doe not expect from party that technically lost a casethe decision reaffirms the fundamental principle of the collegiate athletic model and of amateurism pacific commissioner larry scott said in a statement studentathletes are first and foremost student who attend college to receive an education and to prepare themselves for success in life while also pursuing athletic excellencescotts statement is more aspirational than descriptive there are basketball player who conclude their college career before finishing even a year of collegesimilarly the reaction from playersrights advocate wa more muted than you might expect postvictorythis is progress but it just one step ramogi huma of the college athlete player association said in a text message this ruling still treat athlete a secondclass citizen no other student or citizen is subject to such harmful economic pricefixing especially one imposed by a repeat antitrust violator that doe not have an antitrust exemptionhow can a judge rule that a law is being broken but allow the lawbreaking to continueaccording to feldman the answer includes a muchdisputed antitrust principle known a the rule of reason in some case including this one the rule call for anticompetitive activity to be overturned only if there is a different system that could provide the positive benefit of the anticompetitive system without suppressing other competition a muchwilken determined that amateurism wa crucial to college sport commercial appeal and allowed it to compete with professional sport even if doing so required it to apparently violate antitrust lawthe court doe credit the importance to consumer demand of maintaining a distinction between college sport and professional sport she saidcourts have given sport league a wide berth when it come to antitrust feldman said the argument is that sport are uniqueafter all sport can not really exist unless say team are allowed to agree to the same rule in men basketball even though that might technically constitute collusion in any other realm of commercewilken wa also following precedent most of all she wa following a precedent set by the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit her circuitin an earlier case known a obannon the appellate court agreed with part of a wilken finding at the district court level that the ncaa ban on compensating athlete for the commercial use of their name image and likeness in thing like video game wa an antitrust violation but the appellate judge overturned her proposal that athlete be able to receive up to annually in exchange the ninth circuit reasoning wa that such payment were not tethered to educationyou can draw a direct line between that phrase from and wilkens ruling in this case that is how she solomonically decided that the ncaa may restrict payment a long a they are noneducationalfuture plaintiff if they challenge ncaa rule will look for a jurisdiction outside of the ninth circuit feldman said the ninth circuit after all ha now made it very clear it will defer to the ncaaanother venue could rule in a more plaintifffriendly direction kessler the prominent sport lawyer may now be able to push forward with a nearly identical case in federal district court in new jerseyeither way the future of college athletics is now out of the hand of wilken who for nearly a decade ha loomed over ither decision last friday may be a result of her understanding her power and it limit numerous observer expected a more plaintifffriendly ruling based on the question she asked during trialyet here we are with little changethis finding did not surprise me said gerald gurney a former head of the reformminded drake groupeven though she may have wanted to completely agree with

action in five month and now at the eightmonth mark is winning significant tournamentswhat bob is doing is incredible su said in a telephone interview on monday he really is demonstrating what determination and his hard work can accomplish with a new implantincredible is quite a word choice from a surgeon who ha performed more than such procedure a few others were on professional athlete trying to save their career including the former major league pitcher colby lewisbut no professional tennis player ha had this procedure and returned to the fore although andy murray who underwent the same type of operation in january in london after plenty of chatting and texting with bryan may try to do the samethe thing that make bob bryan great you dont know if you are going to lose that with

playing like the yearold bobhes exploding to poaches like the old day when he would just steal point from incredible crosscourt return by flashing across the net with the speed of light and picking

are not feeling great and probably a little concerned bryan said but i think he probably feeling really good right nowmurray ha posted video of himself on social medium lightly hitting tennis ball but returning in single with fullcourt coverage required is a more daunting prospecti think a threeoutoffiveset single match is almost close to time more physical than double bryan said it going to really challenge andy the movement but i can jump i can lunge and i am not sore after matchesas murray debated whether to have surgery bryan put him in touch with su who said murray wa an ideal candidate for

millimeter bryan said ive talked to people who had different doctor and have done the same procedure and they feel like crapsu said he believed bryan recovery had been accelerated in part by the use of a relatively new rehabilitation tool an antigravity treadmill which support a player at the hip with an inflatable lowerbody compartment and reduces the risk of fracture in the recovery phaseyou can unweight the body to percent to or su saidsu saw bryan compete in the bnp paribas open in indian well calif last monthi love it just to see what he able to do su said i cringe a little bit when he dive but he done it several time and no worse for the wearwill such acrobatics and the other rigor of professional tennis put bryan at greater risk of requiring followup surgery down the roadthats a really good question we dont have the answer to su said we dont have enough data in term of how it would hold up to activity such a this this ha been done now for almost two decade so there are some

advertisementsupported byby kevin drapermontreal the world antidoping association compliance review committee will meet in montreal the organization home city on monday and tuesday to discus a problem that will not go away russia antidoping laboratory and what to do about the country missing a key endofyear deadlineno matter what the committee recommends and the possibility range from competition ban to mere slap on the wrist to nothing the longrunning story of russia antidoping laboratory is bound to continuehanging in the balance is the credibility of the world foremost antidoping watchdog which ha endured withering criticism from athlete in recent month who say the organization ha allowed a rogue nation to run roughshod over it attempt at enforcementin an open letter last week to jonathan taylor the chairman of the compliance review committee the swedish biathlete sebastian samuelsson wrote given that this doping crisis involving russia is the biggest in history and the fact that many athlete have so shamefully been cheated out of podium position not to mention financial reward by the statesponsored doping system this issue requires proper leadership and good honest communication two thing that have been very neglected by the current wada leadershipwada leader have said they remain committed to clean sport and holding russia to accountroughly four year after russia corruption of the drugtesting process first came to light wadas executive committee voted to in september to allow russia to resume testing it own athlete for performanceenhancing drug even though it had not fulfilled every requirement of a compliance agreementrussias drugtesting agency had been banned since after a vast statesponsored doping scheme wa uncovered while russian athlete were cleared to compete in the winter olympics in pyeongchang south korea they competed under the banner of olympic athlete from russia and russia remains a controversial member of the international sport world in russian athlete had to receive special permission from the international federation governing their sport to compete at the rio gamesindividual federation have handled the situation differently some like the international association of athletics federation which oversees track and field have barred all russian athlete from competing since others like soccer governing body fifa have allowed them to competethe reinstatement of the russian antidoping agency laboratory came with a number of condition attached all of which russia agreed to the most significant condition compelled russia to hand over data from it corrupted antidoping laboratory by the end of the year numerous wada team sent to russia were rebuffed and russia missed the deadlinelast week a threeperson wada team in moscow wa finally allowed into the laboratory to begin collecting data the computer data sought by wada investigator had been sealed off by russian law enforcement leading to the bizarre circumstance of the russian antidoping agency urging the russian government to cooperate with wada on an investigation of the russian antidoping agency own laboratoriesit wa unclear whether the work would be completed before the compliance review committee began meeting at wadas headquarters on monday or if russian law enforcement would impose any more hurdle but even if the work is completed it is highly unlikely that wada official will quickly be able to certify that the data is complete and authentic and some skeptic will not trust the data no matter what because russia missed the deadlineon monday i will be asking have we got the data and if the answer is no it will be a short discussion said taylor a lawyer based in london his implication wa that if the data wa incomplete the committee would have no choice but to recommend russia be declared noncompliantif that happens the future participation of russian athlete in international competition will once again be in doubt a situation that major sport organization like the international olympic committee are desperate to avoida number of sporting figure have called for russia to be declared noncompliant for missing the deadline most prominently wadas own athlete committee ha said it expects russia to be declared noncompliant and that anything le will be considered a failure by wada to act on behalf of clean athletestravis tygart the head of the united state antidoping agency and a vocal critic of how wada ha handled russia sounded a cautious note on fridayof course if accurate it is a good thing that the signal emerging from wada are that it group ha been allowed into the moscow laboratory he said in a statement but in the meantime he belief russia should be declared noncomplianteven if wada obtains all the data managing the process remains complicated the question will be how do we move forward what do we do about the fact that they are late what do we do about the fact that we dont know yet that the data are authentic taylor saidthe committee will make a recommendation and send it to wadas executive committee which is expected to meet later in januarythe executive committee which generally follows the recommendation of the compliance review committee can choose to do nothing and allow russia reinstatement to remain if it decides to once again seek the suspension of russia antidoping laboratory it will send a letter asserting noncompliance laying out a set of recommended consequence russia would then have day to decide whether to agree or to challenge the noncompliance in front of the court of arbitration for sportif wada decline to seek noncompliance the next deadline is june by then russia must submit any stored athlete sample that based on the data wada wish to examinethe data wada seek consists of about suspicious doping sample assuming wada find that a number of them contain evidence of doping it will be up to the dozen of individual sport federation to bring case and charge the athletesin other word whether russia is declared noncompliant or not the continuing fallout from the country doping scheme is likely to stretch deep into especially with the world track and field championship set for september in doha qataradvertisement

siblingslisten to the argument podcast every thursday morning with ross douthat michelle goldberg and david leonhardtcollege sport bring people a lot of joy a one of my college roommate texted me last week a a way of objecting to my recent criticism of sport im happier when our basketball team is good he got a point sport create shared experience in a way that few other activity in this country dothis communal function mean that college have a good reason to treat some athlete differently from most other applicant yes the college should make sure theyre admitting only athlete with the academic preparation to graduate but i understand why the basketball player representing the university of minnesota today dont necessarily need the same academic qualification a the student oboist or journalist at minnesota those athlete bring something to the campus that few other student canwhy in the worldbut it important to remember something else most college sport dont look anything like basketball they dont bring a lot of people together their crowd are small they dont have many spillover benefit for the other part of a university they exist largely for the benefit of the athlete themselves which make them not so different from many other extracurricular activitiesand these other sport are often disproportionately played by white relatively welloff student they dont add much diversity to a campus only percent of male college lacrosse player are black a justin wolfers of the university of michigan ha noted only percent of fencer are in golf the share is percent in water polo it percentyet college treat athlete in these sport a an entirely different specie of applicant the athlete dont need to have nearly a strong application a other studentsbecause so many of these sport exist the share of athlete at some college is shockingly high roughly percent or onefifth of the entering class at the ivy league university and the leading small liberal art college are recruited athlete jonathan cole a top former official at columbia university and before that a college athlete ha written why in the world are the school using up percent of their slot on recruited athlete the answer cole explains is that sport have become a kind of arm racein a recent newsletter i mentioned that about one in five student at williams college in western massachusetts wa an athlete according to an outside estimate that turn out to be wrong and too conservative williams is on the high end of the distribution with about percent of student being recruited athlete according to the collegecole is right that this situation doesnt make any sense i am fully aware that fencer golfer water polo player and other athlete work extremely hard but so do many other student who participate in other extracurricular activity and have superior academic record those other student are often rejected to make room for the athlete the problem is the special treatment that so many athlete are receivingin a better system most college would substantially shrink the number of athlete they recruit each would keep a modest number of sport split equally between men and woman for which they would recruit athlete and still give huge admission bonus these wouldnt be the only team that college fielded but the other sport would follow a classic scholarathlete model the member of the team would no longer receive extraspecial treatment in the admission process they would be student who happened to be athlete and they would compete with other team filled with similar athletesis

the left ventricle in response this part of the heart in athlete typically becomes larger and stronger than in sedentary people and function more efficiently filling with blood a little earlier and more fully and untwisting with each heartbeat a bit more rapidly allowing the heart to pump more blood more quicklywhile almost any exercise can prompt remodeling of the left ventricle over time different type of exercise often produce subtly different effect a study found for instance that competitive rower whose sport combine endurance and power had greater muscle mass in their left ventricle than runner making their heart strong but potentially le nimble during the twisting that pump blood to muscle these past study compared the cardiac effect of landbased activity though with an emphasis on running few have examined swimming even though it is not only a popular exercise but unique swimmer unlike runner lie prone in buoyant water and hold their breath all of which could affect cardiac demand and how the heart responds and remake itselfso for the new study which wa published in november in frontier in physiology researcher at the university of guelph in canada and other institution set out to map the structure and function of elite swimmer and runner heartsthe researcher focused on worldclass performer because those athlete would have been running or swimming strenuously for year presumably exaggerating any differential effect of their training the researcher reasonedeventually they recruited nationalteam runner and another comparable swimmer male and female some of them sprinter and others distance specialiststhey asked the athlete to visit the exercise lab after not exercising for hour and then when on site to lie quietly they checked heart rate and blood pressure and finally examined the athlete heart with echocardiogram which show both the structure and functioning of the organit turned out to no one surprise that the athlete whether runner or swimmer enjoyed enviable heart health their heart rate hovered around beat per minute with the runner rate slightly lower than the swimmer but all of the athlete heart rate were much lower than is typical for sedentary people signifying that their heart were robustthe athlete also had relatively large efficient left ventricle their echocardiogram showedbut there were interesting if small difference between the swimmer and runner the researcher found while all of the athlete left ventricle filled with blood earlier than average and untwisted more quickly during each heartbeat those desirable change were amplified in the runner their ventricle filled even earlier and untwisted more emphatically than the swimmer heart didin theory those difference should allow blood to move from and back to the runner heart more rapidly than would happen inside the swimmersbut these difference do not necessarily show that the runner heart worked better than the swimmer say jamie burr a professor at the university of guelph and director of it human performance lab who conducted the new study with the lead author katharine currie and otherssince swimmer exercise in a horizontal position he say their heart do not have to fight gravity to get blood back to the heart unlike in upright runner posture doe some of the work for swimmer and so their heart reshape themselves only a much a needed for the demand of their sportthe finding underscore how exquisitely sensitive our body are to different type of exercise dr burr saysthey also might provide a reason for swimmer sometimes to consider logging mile on the road he say to intensify the remodeling of their heartsof course the athlete here were tested while resting not competing he say and it is not clear whether any variation in their ventricle would be meaningful during racesthe study also wa crosssectional meaning it looked at the athlete only once they might have been born with unusual cardiac structure that somehow allowed them to excel at their sport instead of the sport changing their heartsdr burr however doubt that exercise almost certainly remake our heart he say and he hope future experiment can tell u more about how each activity affect u and which might be best for different peoplebut even now he say an important message is that all of the athlete showed better function than a normal person off the street which support the message that exercise is good for heartsadvertisement

curious positiona year earlier a universitycommissioned report had found that the african and afroamerican study department had offered nearly fraudulent class over almost two decade these class had been disproportionately populated by athlete in the highprofile sport of football and basketball who in some case were steered by athletic department tutor who knew the course required little workthe result wa one of the worst academic scandal in college sport history and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and it proud athletic program the university accreditation body placed north carolina on probation the ncaa conducted an investigationbut critic saw few systemic changesthered been none of these public forum no sign of lesson learned smith said recentlya history professor whose area of study is prerevolutionary france smith had been agitating about the scandal for several year he had even written a book about the affair cheated with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classesi thought i can not rely on this institution to do the right thing smith said and i think it would be an abdication of responsibility for u to pas up the opportunity to provide student at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal how it happened what it say about college sport what it tell u about the plight of athletesand that is why earlier this week a the men college basketball world turned it attention to the final four an event the tar heel qualified for in and winning the title in the latter year well over undergraduate heard smith lecture on the scandal a part of his increasingly popular course history bigtime college sport and the right of athlete to the presentstudents in the class read cheated and pay for play a

although he wondered whether his superior took it that way when two senior administrator seemed to be pressuring the thendepartment chair to cancel the course a few year ago the official said their question about the course had nothing to do with it content the provost overturned a grievance committee finding that the official interference had been unduemore righteous than selfrighteous smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sport system at north carolina and elsewherehis class he insisted doe not have an agenda but it certainly ha a point of view and that includes the notion that effort like the class itself are futileby examining all these earlier episode of growth followed by handwringing and effort at reform which inevitably fail what they see is there are systemic feature in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable smith saidsmith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality one in which the scandal resulted from the working of the college sport industry including how it prevents athlete from getting a piece of the profit they generatewhile smith ha clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sport industry rather than to college athlete this ambiguity lead to misconception according to lydia thompson a senior on the rowing team who is taking the classstudents hear critique of the way in which athlete have been abused by the educational system thompson wrote in an email and automatically extrapolate those critique and apply them to athlete who merely have to abide by the rule of that systemsmith ha taught at chapel hill since having arrived during the era of good feeling associated with the legendary late basketball coach dean smith no relation i drank the koolaid he saidwithin three year of his arrival though according to a university report the academic fraud had begun it did not begin to come to light until right around when jay smith involvement with it commencedthat summer a football player named mike mcadoo sued the university and the ncaa over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct a studentrun honor court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnote but the paper which wa disclosed in court filing included plagiarism and that discovery led to a stream of revelation that eventually exposed the fakeclasses scandalsmith wa serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honor court when a reporter asked to discus mcadoo smith looked up the paper and wa flabbergasted he said not only by it blatant evidence of plagiarism but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course julius nyangoro wa not a language instructor nyangoro the african and afroamerican study chair wa later found to be complicit in the scandalall of this smelled really really fishy to me smith saidsmith and a few other faculty member convened an ad hoc group for academic reform a neophyte when it came to college athletics smith wa tutored by richard southall a professor who directed the university college sport research institutesouthall whose institute is now housed at the university of south carolina said he gave the group a primer on college sport with the thesis that scandal are the regular inevitable consequence of the conflict between the ncaas

it the course first taught over the summer of came naturally to him a a historian he said you look for development over time charting both continuity and change and you identify the issue that seem to

the baseball field very often their scouting director eric kubota said then praising murray instinct despite his relative lack of baseball experience he just a tremendous athlete which can translate to the baseball field in a lot of way he ha a chance to really be dominant on both the offensive end and from a defensive standpointkubota said the risk of murray playing quarterback at the university of oklahoma wa worth takingfrankly were kind of excited to be an oklahoma fan for game he saideverybody know what happened next those regularseason game led to the conference title game and the orange bowl and by the end murray had more than allpurpose yard overall touchdown a heisman trophy and a new career pathmurray announced via twitter on monday that he wa firmly and fully committing my life and time to becoming an nfl quarterback his statement made no mention of baseball the a or the million deal he reached with them last june with the promise to play only baseball after the college football seasonthe a were the first team to hold formal workout for pitcher and catcher on monday they started earlier than other team to prepare for a seasonopening series in japan with the seattle mariner on march and and murray will not be joining them he will return million of his million signing bonus according to espn and will not collect the remaining million that he wa due to be paid next monthhe had been assigned a locker in the clubhouse and on monday morning oakland official had expressed hope that murray would soon slip into his no jerseybob melvin the a manager said he wa cautiously optimistic that murray would choose baseball according to the san francisco chronicle yet realistically those hope had been dimming since murray declared for the nfl draft on jan the a retain his right should murray ever reconsider but they will get no compensation pick for his defection they gambled and lost but baseball lost even biggermurray teased the possibility of playing both sport in a photo he posted to twitter in november reenacting a ubiquitous bo jackson photo from the s by posing shirtless with football pad on his shoulder and a baseball bat behind his backbut jackson of course did not play quarterback an allconsuming position that leaf no room for distraction to maximize his appeal to team and his potential for success murray chose football exclusively which most likely will bring him more money at least at first and definitely offer a quicker path to glorythe sport are fundamentally different in their development process of course almost every baseball player log year in the minor riding bus to remote outpost for a punishing daily test that is at least a much mental a physical a firstround nfl quarterback is typically hailed a the instant savior of his franchisemurrays predecessor a heisman trophy winner and oklahoma quarterback baker mayfield needed one month to establish himself a the starter for the cleveland brown he sat the first two week came off the bench in week and wa starting for good by sept whats more appealing to a yearold athlete the mayfield plan or a summer trying to hit slider for an a affiliate in beloit wi or stockton califmurrays uncle calvin murray offer an example of the uncertainty of life a a baseball prospect the san francisco giant chose calvin murray with the seventh overall pick in the draft he played more than professional game but fewer than in the major the player taken one pick before murray did just a bit better his name wa derek jeterwell probably never know what kyler murray could have been a a baseball player he could always try the sport again if football fizzle a tim tebow is doing with the mets but baseball a an institution doe not give itself the best chance to attract an athlete like murray whose bonus potential wa limited by the strict draftslotting system instituted in the draft system ha always incentivized losing to some extent in and the washington national plotted a new course by taking stephen strasburg and bryce harper first over all in consecutive draft but by awarding a fixed amount of bonus money to team with the worst team getting by far the largest allowance the new rule have greatly encouraged protracted rebuildingthe houston astros understood this better than most and became a perennial power by using the system to their advantage they have spawned so many imitator that a record eight team tallied loss last seasonthe player union ha been dismayed by this trend which ha lessened demand and therefore salary for veteran free agent murray case show another regrettable consequence perhaps if the a had been able to offer more money to murray last june they could have kept him off the football field entirelyinstead their million bought only a halfmeasure allowing murray one final fling with an old flame a it turn out he fell truly madly deeply back in love the a get their ring back but baseball is left at the altaradvertisement

bennerand singer begin to help the fbijennifer medinahe agrees to wear a wire he agrees to go back to the client that he worked with for year and tape in excruciating detail what he done he agrees to call all these people he worked with people he accepted bribe from and people he given bribe to some of these are parent some of these are coach some of these are associate people he paying off in one way or anotherkatie bennertheyre discussing extremely strange bizarre extraordinary measure that very very few people could imagine ever taking in order to get their kid into schooljennifer medinatheres sort of two different way that he operates the first is this athletic scheme where he amasses a number of coach at a number of different school more than a dozen school who agree to accept his bribe and say i want this person on my team all these coach get special slot for athlete they get admitted to university on a totally different track than anybody who not an athletemichael barbaroso these coach are communicating with the admission department at these college theyre almost getting like their own personal bucket of student athletesjennifer medinaabsolutely thats exactly the way it work you get to say this is who i want on my team and the admission office essentially agrees to go along with what you say so he paying off these coach in all these different collegesmichael barbaroand how do the coach pretend that someone is a legitimate athlete when theyre not and how do the parent play along with that a welljennifer medinaso he had a very elaborate scheme in lot of case one of his typical way of operating apparently wa to fake photo in one case he said i need a picture of an asian girl playing soccer and were going to photoshop the applicant face onto this photomichael barbarowowjennifer medinaalmost every case that we know about this person never played on the team they would drop out a soon a they arrived on campus in some case the kid didnt even know that they were expected to play on this team they created a profile saying that this kid ran track and he get to campus and is speaking to a college counselor and the counselor say oh so i see you run track and the kid say what are you talking about he didnt even knowmichael barbarook so thats one scam this kind of sport coaching method scam what wa the other scam that the fbi discoveredkatie bennerhe talked about how he arranged for student to take their sat or act exam at special site where he had bribed the proctor on those test to basically correct the student answer he talked about how he encouraged the parent to get their child tested for disability so that they could have more time to complete the exam he talked about how he would sometimes even have a man an adult pose a the student at the test center that he quote unquote controlled and that adult would take the test for the kid and this guy wa so good at it he could basically get any score that they wantedmichael barbarojenny and katie youve described an elaborate system of wealthy parent bribing their childrens way into college arent there le risky way for rich people to get their child into collegejennifer medinathe world of college admission for the extremely wealthy is really complicated so there are three way to get in first youve got the front door there test there grade there your extracurricular activity your achievement there also the issue of legacy if your parent went to this college youre trying to get to youll probably get some extra point if you play a sport you might get some extra point so you can be on their team thats the front door and then there the back doorkatie bennerthere are so many legal way that the ultrawealthy have been gaming the system for a long time to get their kid into school they donate tremendous amount of money they help people build building and work on development projectsjennifer medinaand this is also the world where you have incredibly highend tutoring this is not just spending a couple hour learning how to navigate an sat this is hundred of thousand of dollar many time over year to come up with all sort of elaborate way to brand yourself essentially into something that you think will get you into the right college whatever you consider the right college to be so then there this third door what singer referred to a a side door which is essentially just bribingkatie bennercheatingjennifer medinacutting out the middleman or cutting out the pretense of anything other than paying people off and bribery and i think the reason why this case is so fascinating and were sitting here talking about it and everybody is so interested in it is the difference between these two door the side door and the back door now if youre the fbi that line is very clear it clear that it is completely illegal to simply bribe somebody to get your kid into the college of your choice but if youre one of these parent where youre operating in a world where you know many people are paying ten of thousand of dollar or hundred of thousand of dollar to university in an often successful attempt to get your kid into the college then maybe this doesnt seem so strangekatie bennercertainly we know it breaking the law and certainly you can tell from the recording that were transcribed by the prosecutor that the parent knew they were breaking the law but they also dont act like breaking the law is a completely big deal and they seem to operate in a parallel universe with different consequence for themjennifer medinathey knew that this crossed a line they did it anyway the why of why they did it anyway is actually really interesting and really complicated it not a though if these kid went to college their income potential wa going to grow enormouslymichael barbarobecause theyre already richjennifer medinatheyre already wealthy and study have shown that people who go to college and are already coming in with wealth do not necessarily see a huge jump in their income over a lifetime on the other hand thats not true for kid who come from poorer family there is a lot that show especially if you go to a highly selective college and if youre successful there lot of thing that show your income potential go way up it is a path to the middle class thats what weve always thought of college a being a path to the middle class but it not clear that if youre already part of the mostupper class that you need to go to some specific college to stay in that upper classmichael barbaroso why then why do these parent who can afford to participate in this kind of scam why do it if there no tangible benefit why take that riskjennifer medinai dont think it about economics that might be part of it or they might tell themselves that it part of it but it is obviously at least somewhat about status about maybe being able to put that sticker on the back of your car that say my student go to yale university maybe it that you want to give your kid some perfect social experience that you think theyre going to have at this right school or maybe you just want to save your kid embarrassment clearly these parent didnt have a lot of faith in their kid and whats also really fascinating here is that it not just ivy league school yale is of course the one that is sort of eyepopping and there stanford and there all sort of elite school there also ucla but there also school like wake forest university and university of texas at austin all school that they might have been just fine getting into on their own and are not school that we think of a holding a lot of cachet in these elite circle so what wa that about why were they so willing to spend so much money and so much effort and break the law to get into school we really dont know the answer to that yetkatie benneranother way to look at it from the point of view of the parent is that no matter what their motivation are whether they be social or whether they want an education for their child that they believe is the best education that money can buy they have this feeling that the kid face really long odds college ha never been more competitive i think that harvard accepted about percent of all of the student who applied last year and they understand that college are also looking for a wide array of student a well they dont want a class just packed with all of the people who can pay full tuition donate a million dollar to a development fund and continue to give for the rest of their life because theyre extremely wellheeled theyre looking for something more and they might worry that their student are not extraordinary enough to get in and so theyre going to use the money that they have to try to offset not a systemic inequity like socioeconomic inequity or racial inequity but to offset their childrens own inability to get injennifer medinaa lot of it seems to be about the certainty of it about the security it not a question of maybe you will or wont get into this school it im going to make sure that you have a spot at this specific school that you want to be at that i know i can get you into and i am going to be able to breathe a sigh of relief or celebrate or congratulate you much earlier with much more confidence than i would if i had gone through the front door or even if i had gone through the back doormichael barbaroand where do these privileged kid who were actually implicated in this scheme where do they fit into all of thisarchived recordingi dont know how much of school im going to attend but im going to go in and talk to my dean and everyone and hope that i can try and balance it all but i do want the experience of like game day partying i dont really care about schooljennifer medinaso the kid whose parent participated in this scheme are fascinating it is clear that some of them knew what wa going on but many of them didnt many of them are probably waking up this week stunned to learn the great length that their parent not only went through to cheat on their behalf but the great length they went to to hide it from themkatie bennerthe parent worked so hard to keep their child from knowing what wa going on and this creates a whole other layer of privilege that we see in education that we see in business that we see that these adult parent certainly had in spade this idea that if you do not know all of the wind at your back pushing you forward helping you along you will believe that you deserve everything that you gotjennifer medinatheyve been operating under the assumption that they earned their spot they deserve it and i think this is forcing u to have a conversation to think about what doe deserving it really mean what this ha done is really laid bare for all of u to see in plain view how unequal the system truly is that if you have enough money you can buy your way in but at the same time there are thousand of student who are taking out massive loan to come in and are desperate to get into higher education which our country ha long believed is the way to get into the middle and upper class it supposed to be this system based on your academic merit thats going to give you a path to get from wherever you started from to where you want to be but what weve seen is thats not true if you believe that education and that a college education specifically is the great equalizer or can be the great equalizer of our country what this show you is that that system is completely brokenkatie bennerits difficult to think of a scenario that speaks more clearly to the idea of inequityjennifer medinawhat this really show is that there all sort of way people have been using money and power and influence in this system for year that is completely legal and
