super bowl xiiipoor smith forty year ago he had only his bare hand to try to pull in roger staubachs low pas had he played in a more recent edition of the nfl playoff he almost certainly would have been wearing a pair of the sticky silicone glove that have transformed receiver mitt into virtual spiderman handsthe technological advance on the skin of those glove have been so profound that they now enable receiver to snare pass their forebear never dreamed of catching and in making the seemingly impossible possible they may be changing the way football is playedthe grippy polymer used on the new generation of glove said to be developed first by a canadian wide receiver and a chemist in a pakistan laboratory in is about percent stickier than a human hand according to a recent study by the mit sport lab performed at the request of the new york timesthe technology ha made life easier for receiver at all level of course and now it is rare for any player in search of a better grip pas catcher but also quarterback running back and tight end not to make them part of his standard equipment even defender have taken to wearing themthe glove definitely help with the onehanded catch said rasul douglas a cornerback for the philadelphia eagle who wear a nike version you rarely see guy making onehanded catch without glove onfor those who have not played any football in the last year just touch a pair at a sporting good store it will be obvious why the glove now manufactured by several company are probably the most significant performancerelated football equipment innovation since the advent of the cleattheres no longterm statistical data that ive seen said rich mckay the chief executive of the atlanta falcon and the chairman of the nfls competition committee but they definitely make some difference there no doubt about thatwhen a catch is made the naked eye often see only hand grabbing a ball but what is happening on the palm of a receiver glove is far more complex the scientific principle of polymer adhesion and the miracle of a molecular chain of silicon and oxygen that creates polysiloxanes viscoelastic substance commonly known a silicone rubber silicone is used to make a wide range of product including caulk kitchen tool and silly putty receiver use it to make highlightreel playsaccording to sanat kumar a professor of chemical engineering at columbia university and a specialist in polymer the sticky property exhibited in a viscoelastic medium arises because the material act a both a solid and a liquidit is macroscopically a solid kumar explained of the silicone but at shorter microscopic length it is liquidlikethat liquidlike property make it sticky imagine a tight spiral thrown onto a hard surface like a road it skip right off now imagine the same ball chucked into a large puddle of honey the honey make the grab that is because the silicone surface of the glove is at the microscopic level a viscous honeylike liquid and when a football come in contact with it the ball stall in it the way it would on the surface of a gooey liquid like the honey the ball must work to get through itanette hosoi a codirector of the mit sport lab and an associate dean of engineering at mit is an expert on the interface of soft material she and her student conducted experiment on a pair of blue under armour ua f glove last week to quantify their tackiness basically measuring the force required to pull a leather wilson football over both the glove and over a bare hand in both dry and wet conditionsthe experiment were led by sarah fay an mit doctoral candidate who determined the glove had a coefficient of friction of when dry which is roughly percent more grip force than that of a bare hand coffay also noted that statistically and perhaps surprisingly there is no significant difference between the friction of a wet glove and a wet handlooking over a pair of under armour glove in her office near the charles river hosoi said the key to their performance wa how soft and deformable the silicone is meaning it cover and adheres to the tiniest variation on the surface of the ball enabling it to almost melt into themevery time you get more deformable you get a better adhesion hosoi said after slipping on a pair and palming a leather football with her left handbut a any coach or eagle fan know adhesion alone doe not guarantee catch a douglas the eagle cornerback said before last week loss to the new orleans saint there people with glove on who are still dropping pass every gamethe birth of the current generation of supergloves can be traced to a wintry day at the university of ottawa in a receiver named jeff beraznik who would later found cutter sport glove noticed a star player from rival calgary donnavan blair fielding practice punt with one hand while wearing a pair of orange glovesthe next year beraznik called calgary equipment manager and learned that blair wa wearing glass cutter glove rubbery mitt designed to protect worker and doityourselfers from cut from glass edge those glove he found could be purchased at any hardware storeberaznik bought a pair and modified them to fit more snugly they were not perfect he said but they were good enough and once berazniks teammate stopped making fun of him they all wanted a pair of their ownthe whole team wa like pas me a pair of those glass cutter glove beraznik said hence the name of his company cuttersberaznik spent month after college traveling the world seeking the perfect material one that wa stickier but also le bulky he teamed with a safety glove company in toronto called midas which sent him to a lab outside karachi pakistan to work with one of it chemistswith a football in hand beraznik made repeated trip to karachi in the late s at time rolling up his sleeve to work on the formula adding a little more of this and a little le of that one day he and one of the chemist arrived at the current formula which wa dubbed ctackthe modern glove a huge improvement on the scuba diving glove worn by nfl receiver at the time wa born other manufacturer including a company founded by jim sandusky another canadian football player were working on similar product eventually nike reebok under armour and others produced their owneven lester hayes the former oakland raider cornerback who wa known for smearing his hand and body with a ridiculously sticky goop in the s wa impressed after he came across a pair of cutter he sent a handwritten letter to beraznikthis is the greatest invention since stickem he wrotethat product known by it brand name stickum wa outlawed by the nfl in because of the utter mess it made sticking not only to user but also to opponent referee and the ball themselves the silicone glove are allowed because they leave no residue on the ball according to rule section article item of the nfl rule book player may wear glove with a tackified surface if such tacky substance doe not adhere to the football or otherwise cause handling problem for playersthe most obvious result of the glove can be seen in the startling onehanded catch that came into fashion after odell beckham jr of the giant made the most famous of all onehanded grab against the dallas cowboy in now almost everyone in the nfl college and even high school ha done itin the rose bowl this month hunter bryant a sophomore tight end at the university of washington leapt for a high pas in the final two minute of that game and palmed the ball with his gloved right hand by using only one hand he wa able to extend his reach and fend off his opponentin a telephone interview bryant said that like most player today he ha worn silicone glove since he played youth football but once he saw beckhams gloved acrobatic snare on sunday he began practicing themeveryone practice them now he said ive gotten pretty good at ithunter also noted that he feel he can sometimes get a better grip with bare hand but he wear those sticky glove anyway he doesnt want to find himself lying in the end zone without the ball one day wringing his bare hand the way jackie smith once didadvertisement

advertisementsupported byby tariq panjaover the past four year some of the most damning secret of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leak that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport most popular club player and coacheslast week the man behind the leak a yearold portuguese citizen named rui pinto wa arrested in budapest hungary he face extradition to his home country on the charge which include an extortion attempt in on a secretive investment fund that had bet million of dollar in the player transfer marketfor the moment though pinto fate depends on a far narrower matter whether his team of lawyer can successfully argue that he is a whistleblower under hungarian law a defendant whose action to expose malpractice and potentially a raft of financial and other crime in soccer outweigh any offense he might have committedin the view of the portuguese authority pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund doyen sport they and doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company document revealing transfer fee and secret payment unless the fund paid him to keep the document privatethose document which offered a window into both doyen business model and it bank account were later published on the website known a football leak the revelation along with a number of player contract posted on the site exposed a murky world of soccer finance that wa at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulationsultimately pinto turned over about million document and terabyte of information to a german newsmagazine der spiegel which shared document with a select group of news medium outlet who published report on their contentsnow that pinto ha been arrested on a portuguese warrant his case represents a highprofile test of a hungarian law passed in that affords special protection to whistleblower his lawyer plan to argue that the lead his leaked document provided to a variety of european law enforcement organization outweigh pinto actionsbased on the leak there have been some extremely important criminal investigation opened with prosecution in various country said william bourdon pinto lawyer who previously ha represented the nationalsecurity whistleblower edward snowden without pinto this wouldnt have been possiblethose investigation include several tax case in spain where top soccer star including cristiano ronaldo have been prosecuted for tax evasion after football leak revealed detail of the complicated structure through which they received million of dollar in salary and image right pinto lawyer said that he also ha been in contact with french financial crime prosecutor since late more recently football leak disclosure have targeted the fifa president gianni infantino and the way some top club might have circumvented the sport financial regulation the revelation also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against ronaldounlike in most whistleblower case however pinto ha no official connection with the soccer industry no access to club book or a player contract beyond being a fan of the gamefor me it doesnt make a difference considering what is the basis of whistleblower protection the intensity of the contribution to the public interest bourdon said this is the key pointbourdon said pinto already had agreed to assist the authority in switzerland and that germany tax agency wa seeking access to his information too but it is the decision of a hungarian judge that matter most to him at the moment since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to portugalwe expect the hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation bourdon said that on one hand he being prosecuted in portugal while on the other he ha been providing assistance to prosecutor in other countriesbourdon said that he see little difference between pinto and one of his former client hervé falciani who leaked account detail of client of the british bank hsbc while he worked in geneva falcianis disclosure which shook the secretive world of swiss banking revealed account containing more than billion and led to the bank agreeing to pay million euro about million to french authority to settle a taxevasion investigationspains high court last september rejected an extradition request for falciani once labeled the edward snowden of banking from switzerlandin addition to pinto extradition the portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in hungary bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected extortion attemptbourdon acknowledged that pinto had attempted to make contact with doyen once he had the company document but he said the extortion charge were not valid because pinto ultimately didnt follow through with an operation to secure a paymentbourdon described the charge a a tool to criminalize him to target him a an offender and not a whistleblowerlittle is known about pinto a der spiegel reporter rafael buschman is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with football leak buschman ha written a series of breathless account and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to a john der spiegel ha not confirmed pinto is it sourcebut a september report by the portuguese magazine sabado reported pinto wa the computer genius behind football leak shortly

advertisementsupported byon pro footballby ken belson and kevin draperthe nfl owner worried about a protracted legal fight they fretted over potentially embarrassing disclosure they were concerned about further alienating fan and sponsor so they took the unusual step of reaching a settlement rather than continue to battle an adversary who wa viewed in some circle a a victim of the league sharp elbowsall of this happened nearly six year ago when the league found it more expedient to pay hundred of million of dollar to retired player who contended the nfl had concealed the danger of repeated hit to the head among other thing the concussion settlement enabled the league to avoid the acute discomfort of battling in court with former player who had sustained neurological damagein many way the nfl followed this same road map on friday when it announced that it had reached another settlement this time with the former san francisco er quarterback colin kaepernick and his former teammate eric reid they had accused the owner of colluding to keep them out of the league because they had knelt during the playing of the starspangled banner at game an action that prompted other player to do so a wellthe nfl ha a reputation for using a scorchedearth legal strategy and it decision to settle in both case have been viewed by some a admission of guilt in fact the league did not acknowledge wrongdoing in the concussion settlement and it is not clear what it may have admitted to in friday settlement because of a confidentiality agreement between the two sidesstill by settling each time the owner may have calculated that they and many fan could then try to move past the contentious issue at the heart of the two case the longterm effect of repeated head trauma in the first instance and the right of player to protest in the second instancethere are broader issue than just money that the league considers said matthew j mitten the director of the national sport law institute at marquette university they need to take into account social issue and public perceptionthe two case in some way are very different one wa a classaction lawsuit involving retired player who sued in federal court the other a grievance filed under the collective bargaining agreement the league stood a chance of winning both case had it persisted but each case generated year of negative publicity so the league which earns billion a year wa in a position to spend money to make both case go awaysignificantly the two settlement provide the league with a measure of protection mitten said the concussion settlement precludes player in the future from suing the league for concussionrelated damage and the settlement with kaepernick and reid avoided any adverse precedent being setkaepernick had not played a down since the end of yet he continued to hover over the league every time a backup quarterback wa signed kaepernicks name wa invoked if only to ask why he remained out of the leaguemark geragos the lead attorney for kaepernick and reid told cnn on saturday that he thought kaepernick would get a shot at an nfl job now that the litigation wa overill make the bold prediction and you can save the tape geragos told the network i think youre going to see within the next two week that somebody going to step up he added it would not surprise me if bob kraft make a move referring to the owner of the new england patriot who just won their sixth super bowl titlegeragos also mentioned the carolina panther who signed reid a few week into the season a a potential landing spot for kaepernickgeragos who ha made similar prediction in the past did not cite any source to back up his assertion a patriot representative declined to comment and the panther did not return a message requesting a response to geragoss remarksstill even off the field kaepernick ha loomed large before the season began kaepernick persuaded the arbitrator in his case to dismiss the league attempt to throw out his grievance then he announced a lucrative endorsement deal with nike which provides uniform to all nfl team to add to the owner discomfort nike also made kaepernick a face of it just do it campaign putting out a commercial narrated by him during the opening game of the seasonthis ha been a pr nightmare for the league and in some sense it remarkable that kaepernick proved himself to be a larger public figure than the nfl with his nike deal said michael leroy who teach sport law class at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign he outshined the league in a very significant waythe presence of kaepernick who rarely speaks in public also hung over the super bowl this month the basketball star lebron james and kevin durant were photographed wearing kaepernick jersey on super bowl weekend the rapper common tweeted a photograph of himself alongside the longtime activist angela davis who wa wearing a kaepernick jersey and the filmmaker ava duvernay said on twitter that she wa boycotting the super bowl in support of kaepernickdays before the game the nfl canceled it traditional news conference for the performer of the halftime show after report emerged that several prominent musician in gesture of support for kaepernick had turned down a chance to take part in the showthe league also had to consider the arbitrator in kaepernicks case player file dozen of grievance every season but most are resolved without becoming public kaepernicks case though wa being heard by stephen b burbank the arbitrator who ruled in august that kaepernicks lawyer had gathered enough evidence for the case to proceeda university of pennsylvania law professor and an expert in contract law burbank ha worked a an arbitrator for the league since and ha a reputation for independence he began his law career a a clerk for warren burger then the chief justice of the united statesone of his first task for burger wa to proofread the monumental united state v nixon ruling in in which president nixon wa ordered to turn over tape recording and other material in connection with the watergate case more than year later burbank is wrestling with case that may not be a historic but still carry plenty of significancehe told me once the main qualification of the job is not having any skin in the game said stephen walter a friend of burbank who clerked with him on the supreme court he isnt an nfl fan of any sort but he is the perfect guy for the jobkaepernick and the league could have been encouraged and worried by burbank previous ruling a an arbitrator over the year he ha at time ruled for the player a he did in a case involving miscategorized ticket revenue he ha also ruled for the league a he did in a case involving the circumvention of the salary cap and in a case involving revenue sharing he ruled in part for the league and in part for the playersreid filed his case in may while he wa a free agent and wa drawing limited interest despite having just finished his best season statistically the panther ultimately signed reid to a oneyear million contract after the third week of the season and this week they gave him a more lucrative threeyear extensionreid missed only three game before joining the panther and kaepernick ha been out of the league for two season in that sense the potential monetary damage reid could have won with a favorable ruling from the arbitrator were probably much le than kaepernick could have won in any case he ha settled too and the nfl can try to move onthe nfl ha so many other issue around player health and wellbeing they need to remove all the other static said jodi balsam a professor at brooklyn law school who worked a a lawyer for the nflit is worth recalling that during the recent super bowl in atlanta which took place le than two week before the league settled with kaepernick and reid the nfl invited civil right leader to take part in the pregame coin toss in doing so the league wa embracing pioneer who helped bring social change to the country and particularly to the south but some wondered whether the nfl wa also trying to counter the effect of kaepernick whose principled protest continued to resonatenow the league ha settled with kaepernick and with reid still if the concussion case is any indicator merely settling will not make the issue that kaepernick raised simply go away after all nearly six year after the concussion settlement the nfl is still dogged by story of former player in dire mental and physical health and fear that football can cause brain damage have now reduced participation in youth footballin the end settlement no matter what is at stake can go only so faradvertisement

franchiseit is hard to believe that a little more than four year later beckham ha been brusquely jettisoned from the team on tuesday the popular if sometimes mercurial beckham wa traded to the cleveland brown for jabrill pepper a safety with a modest record of nfl achievement and two draft pick the th and th of next month draft that while valuable are not likely to yield a star of beckhams magnitudebeckhams mystifying departure may be a window into a new nfl in which player and team can transition from seemingly amicable partner beckham signed a fiveyear million contract extension with the giant about six month ago to rival on opposing sideline faster than ever beforestar player were once bound to team for many year because restrictive guideline made unfettered free agency hard to achieve there is more movement in the modern nfl and even beckhams contract which at the time made him the highestpaid wide receiver in football did not mean that the giant wanted him around for long still beckhams trade did not happen in a vacuum in the last week antonio brown and leveon bell whose offensive production in pittsburgh made them prospective hall of fame player moved on from the steelersbeckham surely played a role in his exit he embarrassed himself and the team with his manoamano slugfest with josh norman which contributed to a giant loss his end zone celebration could be profane and his antic on the sideline selfaggrandizing a the leader of an illadvised overnight florida boating trip when the team wa preparing for a rare playoff game followed by an inferior performance in a loss at green bay he continued to demonstrate a level of immaturitya television interview last fall in which beckham did not show support for quarterback eli manning and seemed to question his teammate effort produced more handwringing in the giant office at the highest level including ownership a portion of the giant fandom also began to sour on beckham because of his volatilityin today nfl some team choose to abandon their hefty investment in player who are distraction rather than wait for those player to become such problem that they must be moved or team executive ditch the player before he try to force a trade a brown did and in that way maintain their trading leveragethe real surprise in the beckham case is that it wa the staid giant who chose to push their most talented and popular player out the door and to do it in his prime the giant are historically much more conscious and concerned about fan reaction to their transaction but not in this situation beckham wa dispensable even if it meant that the ten of thousand of giant fan with one of beckhams replica jersey hanging in a closet many of them prized fan under the age of were thunderstruck by tuesday dealthe giant fan base is already reeling and not just because it team ha had one winning season since beckhams trade is just one of several recent purge of the team roster that have left many fan confounded and angry there are for example only three player remaining from the team week starting lineup in moreover if there is a clear path that the giant are following indeed if there is a plan at all it not easily decipheredyes the giant are in a rebuilding mode but they will have to rebuild with financial constraint about million of beckhams salary will count against the giant cap and more startling thats le than half of the million on this year salary cap ledger for player who are not here anymore the giant also recently traded or cut player like cornerback eli apple defensive end olivier vernon defensive tackle damon harrison and offensive lineman patrick omamehand manning is due about million next season that total could be reduced if manning is cut in a few day before his bonus is due if that happens it may provide some clarity on the front office apparent overall strategy of tearing down everything to start over but losing manning on top of beckham may leave some giant loyalist apoplectic if not catatonicin the end beckhams exit underscore another relevant pattern every giant firstround draft choice from to ha either been traded or released by the team of the player the giant selected from to only six remainmore than any other factor that is why the giant have lost of their last game and have not won a playoff

the league commissioner broad authority to penalize owner for conduct detrimental to the welfare of the league or professional footballbut while the player essentially work for goodell and have little leverage to influence his decision goodell work for the owner and those owner include robert k kraft of the super bowl champion new england patriotskraft wa charged on friday with two count of soliciting sex a part of a wideranging investigation into prostitution and human trafficking in florida the police in jupiter fla used video surveillance that showed kraft inside a massage parlor that the police said wa used for selling sexin a statement the patriot categorically deny that mr kraft engaged in any illegal activityhowever the case is resolved the episode is an embarrassment to a league that like to portray itself a a pillar of moral rectitude but that ha struggled to shake an image that it player employee and owner treat woman poorlythe league ha been rocked by a host of domestic violence scandal cheerleader have detailed how they were exploited by their team last year jerry richardson the former owner of the carolina panther wa fined million after an investigation confirmed claim that for year he sexually harassed employeesnow thisif kraft is found to have committed a crime even a misdemeanor goodell will be under pressure to penalize him to compensate for the embarrassment the league ha suffered how he treat the matter will provide an illustration of the dynamic of power at the highest rank of the league and show the length he will go to appear to treat player and owner equally before the expiration of the current labor deal two year from nowkraft may be the league most successful owner his franchise ha won six super bowl title since the season a a

and the league gobetween with president trumpthat said the nfl includes it share of misfit and wayward son and from time to time the patriarch or in this case the commissioner ha to dole out justice how much justice often depends on the stature of the owner the offense he or she committed and any past transgressionssome case are straightforward when edward j debartolo jr the former owner of the san francisco er pleaded guilty for failing to report a felony arising from a gambling fraud and extortion case few were surprised when the commissioner at the time paul tagliabue fined him million and suspended him for the seasonjim irsay the owner of the indianapolis colt who ha a history of substance abuse pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and wa promptly suspended for six game and fined for violating the league personal conduct policykrafts case is more complicated he wa charged with two misdemeanor and those charge may be reduced or dropped a charge of soliciting a prostitute often are kraft is not married his wife myra died of cancer in hugh culverhouse jr who wa involved in league matter when his father owned the tampa bay buccaneer and who practiced federal criminal law for year said goodell would most likely wait to see if the charge against kraft were dropped and then might only issue a fineeven so he suggested kraft wa likely to be treated with kid glove because he is among the most powerful owner kraft also sits on the compensation committee which determines the size of goodells paycheckhe essentially could be sanctioned for bad taste culverhouse said it will come down to embarrassmentin a statement the nfl said it is aware of the ongoing law enforcement matter and will continue to monitor developmentsat the very least the commissioner will have to appear not to have one set of rule for player and another for owner there are difference though player penalty are negotiated by the player union and the league and included in the collective bargaining agreementthe league constitution say goodell can suspend or fine an owner for no more than or both a suspended owner can not go to the team training facility or stadiumif warranted the commissioner can refer the matter to the entire group of owner which can vote to impose additional penaltiesthat is unlikely to happen in kraft case jodi balsam who wa a lawyer at the nfl and now teach at brooklyn law school said the league often wait until legal case are resolved before penalty are assessed prostitution case are often adjudicated quickly she said though this case will receive more scrutiny because it is part of a human trafficking investigationif he is convicted that would seem to bolster the case for commissioner discipline she said and even if he escape criminal penalty the league can conduct it own investigation and decide to penalize himgoodell and the patriot have butted head before over spygate in which the patriot were found to be filming their opponent sideline

advertisementsupported byon pro footballby bill penningtonthere have been a host of terrific nickname in football history but ha there ever been one better than gronkyes it simply the abbreviation of a last name but in this case it seemed to symbolize the essence of the player a nononsense syllable a forceful a a crunching block to seal the end on a sweep a dynamic a a leaping touchdown grab over a hapless defendergronk even sound whimsical or playful which could not be more fittingthe man behind the nickname new england patriot tight end rob gronkowski announced his retirement on sunday at foot and nearly pound he always seemed larger than life but nine year in the nfl will cut anyone down to size after he had surgery to his back arm and knee even a great nickname couldnt save gronk who gingerly and wisely walked away week before his th birthdayeveryone from his teammate to the patriot hierarchy hurriedly lobbed praise at one of the best tight end to play the game and a league lacking in colorful character suddenly ha one fewerwide receiver julian edelman referred to gronkowski a the other goat a in greatest of all time coach bill belichick celebrated gronkowskis unmistakably positive energy tom brady in an instagram post directed at gronkowski said the patriot were almost unbeatable when you were on the fieldindeed gronkowski transformed the position an achievement that will one day make him a certain hall of fame inductee it wasnt just gronkowskis uncommon mix of size and speed he played with an inimitable combination of acrobatic athleticism and reckless abandonwith gronkowski scoring touchdown in his career it hard to single out one that typified his style of play but a yard catchandrun against the kansa city chief in gronkowskis second season revealed the kind of mettle he brought to every snaplined up in the backfield gronkowski grabbed a yard pas from brady then stormed up the right sideline where he evaded three tackler and vaulted toward the goal line while in the air a low hit flipped him upside down but he still kept his forward momentum landing precariously in the end zone on the back of his neck gronk wobbled to his foot then performed his signature spiking of the footballthe patriot won and then there were the offthefield antic he danced on the field and on concert stage chugged beer thrown to him during victory parade impishly mugged for camera behind the back of president obama when the patriot were feted at the white house there were television and movie appearance major role in pro wrestling extravaganza and party after party where gronk always seemed to materialize in character a the eternal goofballalong the way gronkowskis colorful personality brought life to the buttondown patriot and nflthat kind of energy will be hard to replace with pun intended today the nfl feel a little deflatedgronkowskis retirement may also signal another beginning of the end for the patriot everexpanding reign it always seems like folly to forecast the impending demise of the bradybelichick patriot but gronkowski wa unlike any other tight end and he leaf a gaping hole for new englandit is true that the patriot offense is notable for how it can morph week to week and season to season still stellar tight end play ha been a constant to belichicks success and in gronkowski the coach had a weapon who could be a devastating blocker a thirddown possession receiver and a downfield threat mixed into onegood luck finding another talent like that before brady career concludesgronkowskis unmatched value wa on full display in his last football game the super bowl against the los angeles ram the patriot offense wa hopelessly out of sync a drive after drive stalled short of scoring to provide stability new england turned to it running game with gronkowskis punishing block often leading the waythen near the midpoint of the fourth quarter with the game tied the patriot ran the same play three time in a row it wa primarily a pas play but because gronkowski wa one of two tight end in the huddle before each snap the ram had to defend the threat of a rushing attempt by leaving their base defense on the field that meant one fewer defensive back to cover gronkowski if he dashed downfieldwhich is what happened on the last of the three play gronkowski shifted into the slot like a wide receiver and the patriot had the mismatch they sought when ram linebacker cory littleton trotted over at the last second to cover gronkowskias he had so many time before brady lofted a precise pas into a small opening in the defense and gronkowski dove to make the catch inside the ram yard lineon the next play gronkowski sealed the left end with a powerful block on defensive end john franklinmyers and running back sony michel dashed just off gronkowskis right hip for the goahead score in the patriot victorygronkowski briefly celebrated with teammate in the end zone after the score then he slowly and somewhat laboriously jogged off the fieldabout minute later the patriot were draped in confetti at midfield with music blaring along a makeshift stage belichick turned at one point and yelled gronkduly summoned gronkowski grinned at his coach who smiled back and said youre a hell of a playeradvertisement

advertisementsupported bythe ethicistby kwame anthony appiahi have decided to stop watching football given the recent finding about the frequency with which concussion occur and the longterm effect of those concussion on the player i am not trying to take a stand and change any of my family or friend opinion but i do want to feel like im doing my part can i still follow my team in some way though im a jet fan ok maybe im not giving up much by not watching and i really like keeping up with their season what involvement with the team would be ethical can i read up on the team in the newspaper what if i walk into a restaurant and a game is on television is it ok if i watch it there after all theyve chosen to play and maybe i should respect that name withhelda body of research suggests that football cause longterm brain damage in many player still a you point out the player are in a position to decide for themselves whether they want to run the risk those who do well in the sport expect to earn more money and more glory than they would in another endeavor so you could just think this put the responsibility on them if theyre rational they are in effect making the judgment that they are better off playing than not even with a serious prospect of incurring chronic traumatic encephalopathy cte not to mention other chronic injury and conditionsthats not the end of the discussion though when it come to exposing worker to hazard our view arent straightforward bureau of labor statistic from show nonfatal injury among construction worker injury among local lawenforcement officer injury among those for whom driving is part of their job if you choose to be a roofer rather than a groundskeeper and accept a greater risk of injury for more pay were ok with that but the reason we have osha standard is that we think measure to abate hazard should be taken where feasible the potential for grievous injury is surely part of why people watch nascar race we still expect driver to use sixpoint harness and flameretardant suitsit isnt obvious how this principle should be applied to a game like football some think that new hightech helmet will help others argue that no helmet at all would be safer because a in rugby it might discourage head collision player spend much more time in practice than in actual game and some think that practice need to be reformed to avoid the subconcussive impact that have been linked to cte there more research to be done more rethinking of the rule of the game player who lower their head and initiate helmet contact can now be penalized and maybe there a way to expand that penalty category the existing penalty can certainly be increased and made more of a deterrent shortening the preseason could help too but if you really care about the welfare of football player you should want not just to turn your back on bad practice but also to advocate for better onesa utilitarian who ass action by their effect would point out that nothing youre proposing to do contributes to that effort you can avoid newspaper coverage or screen in sport bar but given your refusal to urge anyone else to refrain from attending or watching game that gesture will be undetectable to the football authority not to mention sport journalist and put no pressure on them at least in picking the jet to follow youve made it easier to skip every super bowl from which fate seems to have decided they would be excluded for the past halfcenturybut again thats not the end of the discussion might there be a reason to shun a harmful activity even if doing so wont have beneficial effect there are two line of argument to consider here one associated with immanuel kant and the other with aristotle a kantian test for assessing an action is to consider whether it flow from a principle that youd have reason to want everyone to follow let suppose everyones boycotting football would lead to swift change to make the game much safer or even bring the sport to an end here the utilitarian would note that the end of football might lead to worse life for those who now play the game at all level and to the loss not just of a lot of pleasure among fan but also of job for commentator stadium staff official and the like you can still wonder whether that kantian strategy of the universalized maxim matter if in the real world none of your sportsfan friend are going to follow your leadone reason to refrain from fandom is simply that you may not want to be the sort of person who take pleasure in a game that is causing serious and unnecessary harm to it player an approach to ethic that focus on what kind of person you are socalled virtue ethic is often associated with aristotle it tends to judge action in term of character rather than the other way around and you hear it echo in a familiar formula of reproval what kind of person would let me offer a final consideration in following the game in joining the culture that sustains football in it current form a an american institution you are not causing harm directly but you are in a sense participating in causing harm youve been enlisted in a collective action that you view with disapproval in this regard you can be part of the problem even if the problem would persist if you werentmy husband and i are struggling to conceive weve been seeing a fertility specialist and going through cycle of treatment we started with oral medication to which unfortunately i stopped responding we have since moved on to injectable medication if this doesnt work well at some point have to start thinking about ivf though i desperately want to have a baby of our own im struggling with whether it is ethical to go through the rather incredible length to get pregnant that ivf requires when there are child who urgently need home i know that the cost of adoption and the difficulty of actually successfully adopting a baby make it likely a emotionally grueling and more expensive than a an ivf cycle still the effort would go to providing a home for a baby who need one more pressing is the number of child in the fostercare system weve talked about fostering child in the future but in our mind that would occur after wed had some experience parenting i do not feel that right now we could take on the enormous responsibility of foster care i do feel we are ready for a baby of our own child in foster care generally need a great deal more than a new baby doesthe bottom line is this though i want to have a biological child and my husband definitely doe want to go to ivf if it come to that i am struggling to wrap my head around going through so much intervention when we could instead take in a child who need a home am i off base here or do we have a duty to give home to child who need them when we cant easily have child of our own name withheldtaking on a child who already exists and need a home is an enormously worthy thing to do if youre confident that you can bond with him or her and create a loving environment but you dont have a duty to adopt one there are many thing we each could do such a being a parent to one of the hundred thousand or so foster child in this country who need a new family that would improve the world but morality doesnt demand that we do all the good we can if you had a duty to adopt a foster child it wouldnt be enormously worthy just requiredplenty of couple want to conceive but would choose to have no child rather than adopt a foster child thats essentially the position youre in you dont feel prepared to provide foster care it follows that a child you and your husband might have together wouldnt be depriving a foster child of a home and youre not obliged to remain childlesskwame anthony appiah teach philosophy at nyu his book include

for dan rooney the owner of the pittsburgh steelers at the time who pushed for the regulationsnow the league stated commitment to the rule will be put to the teston monday the number of africanamerican coach fired in soared to five leaving only two black coach in a league where at least percent of the player are africanamericanrace is already a muchdiscussed topic in relation to the league colin kaepernick the former san francisco er quarterback who in began kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism and police brutality toward people of color ha not played in the league for the last two season his protest amplified an already polarizing debate across the country and he ha filed a grievance accusing the nfl of colluding to keep him off the fieldcoaches losing their job at the conclusion of the regular season is routine and expected a they fall victim to the merciless pressure from owner and fan to succeed year after year in addition to the five black coach fired three white coach were let go this season in green bay tampa bay and miami but with the nfl under pressure to increase the percentage of minority coach and executive the makeup of the latest class of jettisoned coach wa especially startlingfour black coach were fired sunday or monday including the jet todd bowles who wa let go shortly after his team final loss sunday the jet had a record in the last three season under bowlesmarvin lewis who had been at the helm of the cincinnati bengal since wa fired monday though he had resurrected the moribund bengal and took them to the playoff multiple time he never won a playoff game and this season wa cincinnati third consecutive one with a losing recordalso fired monday wa denver bronco coach vance joseph who had presided over the first

who are headed to a wildcard playoff game sunday against the baltimore raven and mike tomlin of the pittsburgh steelers carolina panther coach ron rivera who is latino is the only other minority head coachwith eight coaching vacancy it is possible that some of the recently dismissed coach will be leading candidate for those opening their experience and certain attribute may be a better fit with other team jackson for example wa on lewis coaching staff in cincinnati and there are other minority candidate like the kansa city offensive coordinator eric bieniemy and stanford coach david shaw whose name have popped up in coaching discussionsbut the next several week will unquestionably heighten the scrutiny on the nfls hiring practice and how reliably or willingly the rooney rule will be employedgulliver would not admit something that many onlooker and people around the nfl have long suspected that team have been doing only the bare minimum to comply with or sidestepping the rooney rule after all if the rule wa working a intended and the percentage of minority coach and executive wa growing steadily why would the rule need to be strengthenedunder the new regulation enacted a few week ago when team are looking to fill position they must interview at least one minority candidate from a list kept by the league career development advisory panel or a minority candidate not currently working with a team team also must keep detailed record of who they interview which is perhaps a response to criticism from minority candidate who say they are routinely called but not formally interviewed by team trying to do the least possible to fulfill their obligationsafter it wa first established the rooney rule appeared to be having an impact by eight nfl team had coach of color the most to that point or sinceyet at the same time hiring minority front office executive did not keep pace and recently one of the few black general manager in the league reggie mackenzie who wa named the nfl executive of the year in wa forced out a the oakland raider chief football executive ozzie newsome another africanamerican general manager is expected to retire from his post with the raven at the end of this seasonthe nfl ha likewise been challenged in it effort to expand opportunity for black assistant coach a job that is the natural springboard to a head coaching position richard lapchick the director of the institute for diversity and ethic in sport noted in a report that the percentage of assistant coach of color had declined slightly to percent the number of africanamerican offensive or defensive coordinator had dropped from to lapchick saidsince assistant coach typically get swept out the door along with a fired head coach the number of vacant nfl coaching job this week is likely several dozen even if the eight unoccupied head coach position garner all the attentionthat is a lot of interviewing about to take place in the nfl not long after

that ranged from player misconduct to weekly protest during the national anthem but the league bounceback season wa knocked off stride on sunday a official in the two conference championship game made baffling controversial call that to some degree overshadowed the otherwise thrilling matchupsthe call or noncalls left legion of fan feeling their team had been robbed of a chance to advance to the super bowl and left others simply confused once again the conversation monday focused a much on the meaning of penalty like roughing the passer and pas interference and why they were or werent called a it did about the outcome of the game themselvesthe officiating uproar may lead to even more rule change video review and coach challenge those could make game even longer despite the league professed goal of cutting down stoppage and another debate is likely to ensue about the use of technology which sometimes fails to provide the closure it promisesthe most glaring incident the one that will be talked about for year occurred in new orleans where the saint were playing the los angeles ram in the nfc championship game late in the fourth quarter with the score tied and the saint deep in los angeles territory and threatening to take the lead ram cornerback nickell robeycoleman drilled saint receiver tommylee lewis well before the ball arrived the referee could have called a penalty for pas interference or for a helmettohelmet hit but they called neither judgment call like pas interference are not subject to video reviewthe saint were forced to immediately settle for a field goal leaving enough time on the clock for the ram to march down the field and kick a field goal of their own that sent the game into overtime the ram ended up winning it wa simple they blew the call saint

back from a firsthalf deficit against the new england patriot another officiating decision midway through the fourth quarter brought the game to a halt it came when the chief appeared to score a touchdown after patriot receiver julian edelman serving a the team punt returner seemed to have touched a punt that kansa city then picked up and took into the end zone though under the nfls rule the chief would not have been allowed to advance the ball because edelman never truly had possessionafter a lengthy video review the referee determined that the ball never touched edelman even though replay suggested that it might have just barely nicked his thumb the patriot ended up with the ball taking some momentum away from kansa city but the chief quickly intercepted a tom brady pas and went on to score a touchdown anyway still the ruling by the referee wa hard to put asidechiefs fan were also aggrieved by a roughingthepasser call on a secondand in the fourth quarter after defensive lineman chris jones landed a seemingly innocuous slap on brady shoulder a he made a throw a yard penalty wa enforced and the patriot went on to score one of the goahead touchdown that punctuated the last part of the gameand finally after all the controversy the patriot completed a play yard scoring drive in overtime to win the game and move on to the super bowl in atlanta where they will face the

cream havendespite all of this which would figure to turn off the people in a region known perhaps unfairly for it insularity and perhaps fairly for it hatred of pretension brady is now the most favorite son of new england how he managed to pull that off to become bigger than ted williams and larry bird and even big papi david ortiz ha more to do with timing some key lifestyle decision and a certain fight with the nfl over deflated football than his mounting collection of super bowl ringsif you were drawing a sport cartoon and it showed a train and each car in the train represented one of the recent boston championship said richard johnson the curator of the sport museum in boston brady would be the engineer in the front stoking the firefans in american state mostly despise brady and pray to the football god that his patriot never win another playoff game but in new england it almost impossible to overstate brady exalted standing putting brady on par with a kennedy might be a stretch but not a huge oneits also remarkable that at the end of a season that dawned with the potential for polarizing protest during the national anthem sagging television rating and other offfield controversy it ha instead all come back to brady and his dominance after nearly two decade the nfl remains his playgroundpartly because of that the people of the new england region who largely adopt all boston team are living through an era of unusually high accomplishment their professional team celebrate championship from season to season a in spring to fall to winter but in boston it always matter to have been the one who started a movement and like paul revere dashing on horseback to ignite a revolution brady led the charge that ushered new england sport into the st century and it ha been a procession of duckboat parade down boylston street past boston common ever sincean illustrated guide to the nfl playoffsbradys patriot won the franchise first super bowl title at the end of the nfl season that wa about three year before the red sox reversed the curse with their first world series victory since and long before the celtic finally escaped bird shadow and won their first nba championship in more than year and it wa a decade before the bruin won the franchise first stanley cup since throughout that time brady patriot kept winning and while there have been other recent treasured sport hero in boston most notably the still ubiquitous ortiz consider this when the origin story of boston st century sport resurrection is told whose name will be mentioned firstbrady managed to ingratiate himself to the local quickly when he arrived in his first home symbolically wa in quincy mass a diverse citysuburb where two new england institution dunkin donut and howard johnson restaurant were foundedhe wa a familiar sight back then piling grocery in a cart and chatting with other customer at the quincy stop shop restaurant and bar there grew accustomed to seeing him on date and even grew protective of him when those outing attracted paparazzianother factor that made brady not just a favorite son of the region but the focal point of a rebellious usagainstthem cause wa the bizarre spectacle that came to be known a deflategate not surprisingly usagainstthem ha been ingrained in the new england dna ever since a lot of tea ended up in boston harbor about year agoin when brady and the patriot were investigated by the nfl for using deflated football to gain an unfair advantage with brady eventually suspended and by association labeled a cheater in roughly state new englanders were outraged by what they saw a outsider biasthe allegiance to brady is deep and all the more intense because of the shared feeling he wa unfairly stigmatized said doris kearns goodwin the author historian and longtime new england resident deflategate put brady entire reputation and legacy at risk fan here still battle the nonissue with fan elsewhere and it make u love him all the moregoodwin added that she wa recently at a bar in the philadelphia airport and everyone except her and one other patron wanted brady to lose on sundayduring deflategate there wa an infamous ghoulish courtroom sketch made of brady a he took part in a federal proceeding patriot fan were incensed that the handsome brady had been rudely denigratedthe courtroom artist apologized repeatedly and created another more favorable sketchthere are of course two other obvious reason that brady status in new england ha been amplified and they would probably bring him unbridled admiration in any pro sport communityhe hold the record for most nfl victory a a starting quarterback most playoff win most super bowl victory by a player five and most super bowl most valuable player award fourthat will breed a lot of loyalty brady for example is and ha been in the nfl for year you might think that any fan who wanted a replica of his no jersey would have purchased one by nowapparently

been selling faster by percent than it did in the week before any of his previous eight super bowl appearance according to fanatic the largest online seller of licensed sport merchandisehe is also married to one of the highest paid model in the world there is little doubt that part of brady crossover appeal is the understanding that he is the rare nfl superstar whose spouse may be more famous than he isbrady is chasing his sixth super bowl championship and seems to have secured his spot on the boston sport version of mount rushmore there is still room there for williams bill russell and genuflect bobby orr fan of bird will make their casebut the only person who could possibly unseat brady is bill belichick who admittedly already ha a face of stone he first landed in new england a a

abruptly when the sophomore cornerback a j terrell intercepted alabama tua tagovailoa the heisman trophy runnerup and took it yard for a touchdown and basically never stoppedthe victory came a little more than a week after clemson ran through notre dame in the national semifinal that wasnt a byogtype game rather it wa a demolitionyet the root of these performance lay in an incredibly gutsy decision swinney made not amid the playoff high drama but during late september uncertaintyclemson is the plucky underdog whose fan drive around with little tiger tail trailing the back of their truck the tiger stampeded their way through the season and the college football playoff with an outrageously gifted freshman quarterback named trevor lawrence plus plenty of brawn and speed exemplified by a veteran defensive line stocked with future nfl player and a freakishly talented young receiving corpslawrence wa the game obvious star completing of pass for yard and three touchdownswere just little ol clemson said swinney a though selfconscious of both the narrative and how thoroughly his team had just smashed it he added were not supposed to be here but we are but we are and beat notre dame and alabama to do itclemson had plenty of gut this season swinney just showed them very early on much the way alabama coach nick saban swapped out his triedandtested sophomore quarterback jalen hurt

straight conference title for a true freshmanthis decision meant everything under that earlier quarterback kelly bryant clemson wa about a badly crushed by alabama in last year national semifinal a

touchdown on nine catch are really really good at making playsmost people watching monday night game had missed swinneys momentous decision to go with lawrence over bryant because the decision came not at halftime but almost four month agoand it might have been even gutsier than sabans masterstroke last yearin late september swinney announced that lawrence who came out of a prominent georgia high school program a one of the highestrated recruit ever would start against syracuse in the tiger fifth game of the season over bryant who had started the first fourall i envisioned wa him starting that next week against syracuse swinney said a few day agoswinney knew the timing of his announcement would enable bryant to transfer under a new ncaa rule that permit football player to redshirt

to decide he wanted to go somewhere else and play elliott saidit wa a menschy move by swinney it wa also incredibly riskyfor one thing lawrence wa not at that point an obvious improvement over bryant

might be the packer whose leading receiver greg jennings recognized the similarity at once like the chief green bay created a load of turnover a leaguehigh while also scoring the most point the packer also gave up more passing yard and total yard than kansa city did this seasonthe defense recognized it more than even we did a an offense jennings now an analyst for fox said of the imbalance what needed to be done wa what we did we recognized it and we had to make up for itthe packer went before sputtering in their first playoff game against the giant whose offensive coordinator kevin gilbride a could be expected cared only about green bay scheme and personnel and not it defensive ranking he said those were skewed by all the yardage they allowed when leading three week after exploiting the packer blitz the giant sustained long drive that were almost a important a scoring gilbride said to batter new england defense in the super bowl both defense he said outclassed the chiefsoh no question said gilbride who ha analyzed kansa city game film a part of his prep work for nbcs broadcast i think theyre vulnerablethe chief for their part seem aware of their inadequacy especially in the secondary and at linebacker gilbride noted how the team defensive coordinator bob sutton ha tried concealing them with deception by mixing coverage scheme or calling more two high safety look intended to protect them against deep passestheir strength is their passrush which registered sack and that just might be their path to glory this season ha demonstrated that the chief defense need not always play well it need to play well only at certain timesforcing turnover and pressuring the quarterback are more important than preventing yardage the eagle super bowl victory against new england offered convincing evidence the team combined for a single punt and the game turned on philadelphia only sack producing it only takeaway the chief loss to the ram this season in a game with three defensive touchdown reinforced itmaybe youre not playing a well a youd like on defense sutton said but you know hey we can rise up here and we get a stop here and a stop here our offense can take care of thisthe offense ha been so productive that the chief have been ahead for percent of the time theyve been on the field and by point or two possession more than half that time theyve played a staggering defensive snap when leading more than the next closest team chicago according to pro football referencewhen trailing offense tend to throw more often and against defense willing to keep the play in front of them by conceding yardage green an analyst for cbs characterized suttons philosophy a bend dont break though the chief defense broke in their playoff loss last year allowing three secondhalf touchdown to tennessee and in their playoff loss two year ago allowing rushing yard to pittsburgh but not a touchdown and in their playoff loss five year ago allowing secondhalf point that erased a thirdquarter leadthat fiasco came against the colt too but in indianapolis reflecting on the chief flop year ago green blamed the offense he missed some throw a penalty negated a touchdown a lost fumble erased priest holmes yard run he emphasized that he never once believed that the defense would constrain themwe felt we could score on anybody green saidsame with these chief they tallied at least point in of game and averaged at arrowhead where they closed the season by throttling oakland in a performance that safety eric murray said felt more cohesive and le segmentedmurray said he

advertisementsupported byon pro footballby ken belsonthe number of minority coach in the nfl is likely to fall by half next season suggesting that the league recent effort to promote diversity in hiring are still a work in progresstwo week after the end of the regular season nearly every new head coach hired ha been white which is certain to reignite the debate over whether a league in which roughly threequarters of the player are black is doing enough to promote people of color into position of powerthis season there were eight minority coach tied for the most ever yet among eight coach who have lost their job including those fired midseason five were black leaving just three minority coach two black and one latino among the coach in the leaguethus far six out of the seven coach hired by team have been whitethe sudden reversal of fortune for minority coach come after the nfl owner announced in december that they were strengthening rule that obligate team to consider minority candidate when hiring coach and executivesat the time the league denied that it amended the socalled rooney rule named for dan rooney the late owner of the pittsburgh steelers who championed it creation in because it wa not effective enough the rule requires team to interview at least one minority candidate in their search for new coachesthe nfl declined to comment on coach hired this monthwith such a small sample size big fluctuation can happen when a handful of team have down year the sudden decline in the number of coach may look startling but richard lapchick the director of the institute for diversity and ethic in sport at the university of central florida said that number is bound to rise againlapchick noted that there were a record eight minority coach in before the total declined only to have it return to a record eight coach last yearyou cant not notice when that number of black coach get fired he said but he added that it wa a part of the natural cycle of coach getting fired and hired i definitely think it ha a chance to go uplapchick who compiles a racial and gender report card on the nfl and other professional sport league said having eight minority coach in a team league is reasonable rather than comparing the percentage of minority coach to the number of minority player he us the percentage of people of color in the entire country a a benchmarkcyrus mehri the cofounder of the fritz pollard alliance which helped establish the rooney rule and monitor it implementation said his group can not tell team which coach to hire rather the key is ensuring that team give minority candidate an equal shot at obtaining a job and this year every team with an opening ha followed the rule and interviewed at least one and sometimes several minority candidatesyou dont overcome decade of history just by snapping your finger but we have to say the process wa fully followed this year he saidmehri is focused on strengthening the pipeline of minority in junior coaching job so the pool of candidate for head coaching spot deepens he noted the percentage of minority offensive coordinator and quarterback coach is still low minority account for roughly percent of nfl assistantswe think the league ha a lot of work to do he said though in the long run were feeling good where thing are and whats been accomplishedstill the league ha been criticized by advocate and former coach who have said team have been skirting the ruleslast year it wa not clear that the oakland raider conducted any good faith interview with minority candidate for their vacancy at coach before they ultimately hired jon gruden who is whitenow that team have started to fill their coaching vacancy this year the number of minority coach may fall by halfthe arizona cardinal replaced steve wilks who is black with kliff kingsbury a college coach the green bay packer followed by choosing matt lafleur a their coach while the tampa buccaneer hired bruce arians to replace dirk koetter all three new coach are whitethe cleveland brown followed by hiring freddie kitchen a position coach with the team who is white he replaced hue jackson who is black and wa fired during the seasonalso last week the denver bronco replaced vance joseph who is black with vic fangio a longtime defensive coordinator who is whiteand on monday the jet hired adam gase who had been fired by the miami dolphin to take over the team top spot gase who is white replaced todd bowles who is blackthe cincinnati bengal who fired longtime coach marvin lewis who is black are reportedly considering hiring zac taylor who is whitethus far the lone exception ha been the dolphin who are expected to sign brian flores the linebacker coach of the new england patriot once his team is eliminated from the playoffsif flores is hired he would join anthony lynn of the los angeles charger mike tomlin of the pittsburgh steelers and ron rivera of the carolina panther a the only minority coachesthere are only a handful of minority general manager a well reggie mckenzie who wa named the nfl executive of the year in wa fired midseason by the oakland raider where he wa the chief football executive ozzie newsome the first africanamerican general manager in league history retired after working with the raven since they arrived in baltimore in to be sure coach are hired and fired for many reason including most of all success on the field for instance joseph wa in his two season in denver while wilks wa in his one season with the cardinalsteams also change strategic direction and are increasingly looking for offensiveminded coach to match the success of highscoring team in los angeles and kansa citysome black coach also get other job elsewhere bowles for instance wa quickly hired a the defensive coordinator in tampastill the nfl where nearly every owner and many top team executive are white ha battled the perception it doe not do enough to promote minoritiesunder the new regulation enacted in december team looking to fill position must interview at least one minority candidate from a list kept by the league career development advisory panel or a minority candidate not currently working with a team team also must keep detailed record of who they interview which is perhaps a response to criticism from minority candidate who say they are routinely called but not formally interviewed by team trying to do the least possible to fulfill their obligationsafter it wa first established in the rooney rule appeared to be having an impact by eight nfl team had coach of color the most to that point or sincenow it look like the league ha taken a step back with the number of minority coach expected to fall to just fouradvertisement

like i could play in the nfl murray said last month im a confident guyhe added of football ive played this game my whole life and ive always felt like i could do itthere are many way murray

on sunday according to a source with knowledge of the talk where it wa established that the a could offer him a larger majorleague contract murray entered the draft in order to learn more what nfl front office think of him the source saidlate last year murray and his baseball agent scott boras insisted that the plan wa for murray to play one season a oklahoma starter and then report to spring training for the athletics such a deal wa apparently part of the negotiating process that led to murray baseball contract and wa outlined in a news conference last spring with a executivesstill that murray would even entertain the possibility of playing both big league baseball and quarterback on sunday or would be so selfassured of his talent a to make leveraging one against the other a plausible ploy is something new in american sportswhen bo jackson and deion sander were twosport star two decade ago they were a running back and a cornerback those are differencemaking position but

while franchise quarterback sign deal worth million a year after finishing rookie contract that are not exactly ungenerousfootball versus baseball in other word is not the obvious clearcut decision that some might have once thought it wasit is conceivable that murray will not have to choose he is frequently projected a a firstround nfl draft pick and already wa one in baseball firstround pick

treadmill no matter how fast our yard dash isthis much we know for sure should he not withdraw his entry into the nfl draft he will irrevocably give up his final season of eligibility in college

by kneeling during the starspangled banner at national football league game in the president tweeted his anger at him and dozen of other player who also knelt in protest during the national anthem some fan boycotted game over the player action and some boycotted the nfl with the belief that mr kaepernick who failed to land a job the next season wa being blacklisted for his leadership in the movementnow two and a half year later mr kaepernick and a former teammate eric reid have reached a surprise legal settlement with the nfl which they had accused of colluding to keep them out of the leaguein a terse joint statement issued on friday afternoon the league and the player lawyer said that the party have decided to resolve the pending grievance and that there will be no further commenta confidentiality agreement mean that for all the debate and discussion the case generated it ended with a silence that left hanging whether the league admitted there wa any collusion and whether mr kaepernick would ever play another downyet there most likely will be further discussion a people debate whether mr kaepernick wa right and what enduring lesson the owner and league might draw from the sagathe most important thing is he started a really important conversation that weve been having for a couple of year and the people who were willing to have that conversation have learned some thing said michael maccambridge the author of america game the epic story of how pro football captured a nationhe added i suspect even if kaepernick knew how long it would take he might have done it differently but he took a social stand and he wa willing to suffer the consequence of thatmr kaepernick who played for the san francisco er and took them to the super bowl after the season ha not played in the nfl since the season when he began the kneeling campaign at first he sat during the anthem but a former player who is a military veteran suggested he kneel instead to make his point while respecting the american flaghe filed a grievance under the league collective bargaining agreement in october month after failing to find a job and his lawyer have been busy gathering evidence and testimony from numerous nfl owner and league executivesthe case seemed headed to a ruling this spring by an arbitrator until the abrupt statement on friday that left the sport world guessing on whether the league paid the player and how muchafter protesting while playing for the er mr reid also went unsigned for a period before playing most of last season for the carolina panther this week he signed a threeyear contract with the teamit is unclear whether kaepernick will continue trying to play professional football againthe settlement of their case wa another unpredictable twist in a saga that began in august when mr kaepernick an africanamerican little known a an activist began his protest during the anthem he said the gesture wa meant to draw attention to racism and police brutality against people of colorseveral player across the league joined him in kneeling during the anthem generating a national discussion over it and leaving the league flummoxed over how to respond last year the nfl instituted a policy that said player could remain in the locker room during the playing of the national anthem but that if they were on the field they would have to standbut that policy wa suspended after the nfl player association filed a grievance and it wa never enforcedthe sideline protest movement seemed to lose momentum and few player knelt during this past season mr kaepernick ha said little reserving most of his comment for his social medium account during the super bowl this month he posted on his instagram account picture of athlete and celebrity wearing jersey supporting his causeon friday he only retweeted a statement from his lawyer mark geragosmr kaepernick emerged from the protest a both a polarizing figure and a cultural symbol last year nike signed him to a lucrative endorsement deal even though he remained out of the league and largely silent not typically what a brand want from an endorsera year before nike executive had decided to end their contract with mr kaepernick before being talked out of it but with mr kaepernicks growing stature in the civil right movement the apparel company decided to make him a face of it just do it campaign debuting a commercial narrated by mr kaepernick during the opening game of the nfl seasonlegal expert have said collusion case are notoriously difficult to prove which make it highly unusual for the league to settle a case like this it is possible mr kaepernicks lawyer had gathered enough persuasive evidence and testimony from owner league official and football expert that mr kaepernick stood a reasonable chance of persuading the arbitrator hearing the case to rule in his favorfrank hawkins a former senior vice president of the nfl said he thought the league wa probably more worried about embarrassing statement from owner getting out through a hearing than about losing the casepeople say stupid thing thing get taken out of context he said so i think there wa a reasonable potential for embarrassment and it is something that if they could settle it at a reasonable cost they would probably just think it wa worth paying nuisance valuehad mr kaepernick won his case in a full hearing he would have been eligible to receive the money he might have earned if he were signed a a free agent in addition he may have received double that amount in punitive damage in his final year with the er mr kaepernick earned more than millioncarl tobias an expert on civil litigation who teach at the university of richmond school of law said that party settle for all sort of reason even when they believe they may prevail in court but the nfl he said most likely wanted to move on from the issue rather than risk an adverse ruling that could among other thing taint negotiation over the league collective bargaining agreement which will expire in two seasonsi think the nfl just wanted to get this behind them and not have this threat hanging over them mr tobias said i think theyd pay whatever theyd get away with to stop the hemorrhaging and the negative light on the leagueaccording to the collective bargaining agreement between the league and the union the burden is on the player to prove that owner actively conspired against himthat is often difficult to do because party typically dont leave a written record of their illegal maneuvering said william gould who wa chairman of the national labor relation board at the time of the major league baseball strike in mr kaepernick however received a favorable ruling in august when the arbitrator overseeing the case stephen b burbank dismissed the league attempt to have the case thrown out allowing lawyer for mr kaepernick to question owner and league official in a format similar to a trialit wa anticipated that mr burbank would rule on the case in the coming month and a of last week lawyer for mr kaepernick were still preparing for final hearing in front of mr burbank according to a person with knowledge of the preparationseven though mr kaepernick ha not played in more than two year and his play had grown erratic in his last month on the field his name had continued to surface every time an nfl team signed a new quarterback many of these quarterback had le experience or statistically did not seem to measure up to himmr kaepernicks name also continued to be invoked at major nfl event including the super bowl this month when musician said they would not perform during halftime out of sympathy for his casethe associated press reported this week that a new league the alliance of american football spoke with mr kaepernick but that he wanted at least million to consider playing in itmr kaepernicks collusion case at time also exposed a bit of a rift between himself and the player union mr

advertisementsupported byby ken belson and benedict careyexperimental brain scan of more than two dozen former nfl player found that the men had abnormal level of the protein linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy the degenerative brain disease associated with repeated hit to the headusing positron emission tomography or pet scan the researcher found elevated amount of abnormal tau protein in the part of the brain associated with the disease known a cte compared to men of similar age who had not played footballthe author of the study and outside expert stressed that such tau imaging is far from a diagnostic test for cte which is likely year away and could include other marker from blood and spinal fluidthe result of the study published in the new england journal of medicine on wednesday are considered preliminary but constitute a first step toward developing a clinical test to determine the presence of cte in living player a well a early sign and potential riskthus far pathologist have been able to confirm the diagnosis only posthumously by identifying the tau signature in donated brainsprevious study had reported elevated level of the tau signature in single case the new study is the first to compare the brain of a group of former player to a control group using an imaging approach that specifically pick up tau and not other protein in the brainwhat make this exciting is that it a great first step for imaging cte in the living not just looking at single instance but comparing average and looking for pattern by comparing group said kevin bieniek director of the biggs institute brain bank core at the university of texas health science center in san antoniodr bieniek wa not involved in the studyover the past decade the competition for research dollar to investigate cte ha become fierce and political with charge of exaggerated claim and interference by the nfl which ha produced scientific report to rebut any link between the disease and repeated head traumathe group that develops the first useful clinical test stand to attract a surge of funding not to mention potential commercial partnership at least one group in california ha already formed a company to promote it own testthe new study wa led by dr robert stern of boston university which thus far ha the largest collection of donated brain from former pro football player he led a coalition of investigator at multiple center who took brain image from former pro player aged to who had a variety of memory mood and mental problem associated with ctethose image showed marked elevation of tau protein in the area of the brain that display the tau signature when diagnosed postmortem the player tau signal in those area wa higher on average than the tau signal from a control group of men who had not playedwe found a well that the amount of abnormal tau detected in these pet scan wa associated with the number of year playing football dr stern saidhis collaborator included brain scientist from the mayo clinic arizona brigham and woman hospital and avid radiopharmaceutical avid make a molecule called a ligand that bind to protein in this case in the brain avids ligand is the most studied of the socalled tau detector and the company helped finance the studyexperts said the finding were encouraging because any reliable marker for abnormal tau accumulation would allow doctor not only to identify people with cte but also to monitor progress from potential drug treatmentsbut these expert said much more work is required to develop a reliable test for a disorder that is still not well understood a in test for people suffering from alzheimers and other disease that affect the brain researcher have spent year trying to precisely refine the ligand that are ingested by patient before they receive pet scan and other imaging teststhere are also many open question about the tau protein that is a signature of cte researcher are trying to determine whether the protein which occurs naturally in the brain accumulates faster in people who have received repeated head trauma and how those accumulating level are related to behavior associated with cte which include not only memory deficit but also impulse control issue and symptom of depressionthe new study found no correlation between the strength of the abnormal tau signature and the severity of cognitive and mood problem in the former player though the sample wa smallthe search for a test for cte in living patient ha received intense scrutiny since the disease wa first discovered in deceased professional football player year agothe universe of professional player is relatively small only about active player and retiree and the boston group work ha been based on a sample of some of the worst case many perhaps most pro football player do not develop disabling cognitive problem and there are likely many other brain trauma that could potentially result in the cte tau signatureyet football is by far the country most popular sport with more than a million high school student playing the tackle version of the game the detection of cte in former pro player turned what wa viewed a an occupational hazard into a public health debate for year now parent coach school administrator doctor and others have engaged in a dispute over whether child should be allowed to play collision sportspart of that dispute is trying to prove or disprove whether there is a direct link between exposure to repeated hit to the head absorbed in game like tackle football and the development of cognitive and neurological problem later in lifehere the science is emerging study by dr stern and other researcher including in the paper just released suggest that there is a dose response the more hit to the head the more likely you are to develop problem laterbut researcher have questioned study that have shown a high percentage of deceased former football player found with cte they claimed that the research subject were selfselected because the family of player who suspected they had brain disease were more likely to donate their brain to sciencesome researcher are looking at broader population of people who have had traumatic brain injury not just football player to determine whether participation in collision sport a opposed to genetics or other factor is linked to the development of ctetheres a lot of lowerlevel head trauma out there that no one know the consequence of said dr john trojanowski a research at the perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania who

decade of hard hit to make it to a college team or the prosresearch published in the journal of pediatrics last month found that concussion rate for youth football player were higher than previously reported in all some percent of all youth football player receive concussion each year a figure that may sound low but compound with each additional year of play in a study found that playing football

head trauma is ravaging retired nfl playersin the past few decade the nfls emphasis on the passing game and quarterback protection ha led team to stock their offensive and defensive line with everlarger men many of them weighing well over pound but their great girth which coach encouraged and which helped turn some player into multimilliondollar commodity leaf many of them prone to obesity problemsin retirement these huge men are often unable to lose the weight they needed to do their job without the structure of a team and the guidance of coach for the first time in decade many of them lose the motivation to stay in shape or can not even try a damage to their foot knee back and shoulder limit their ability to exercise this is a big reason that former linemen compared with other football player and the general population have higher rate of hypertension obesity and sleep apnea which can lead to chronic fatigue poor diet and even death blocking for a millionayear quarterback it turn out can put linemen in the highrisk category for many of the ailment health expert readily encourage people to avoid linemen are bigger and in today world rightly or wrongly they are told to bulk up said henry buchwald a specialist in bariatric surgery at the university of minnesota who work with the living heart foundation a nonprofit organization that provides free medical test to former nfl player their eating habit are hard to shed when they stop playing and when they get obese they get exposed to diabetes hypertension and cardiac problemsmany linemen say they were encouraged by their high school and college coach to gain weight to win scholarship and to be drafted by the nfl where a lot of player were required to become even bigger in some case player were converted from tight end to down linemen and needed extra weight to play the new position coach often leave it up to the player to decide how to gain weight joe thomas an allpro lineman with the cleveland brown said that a a freshman in college he ate every few hour to gain the pound he needed to get to pound he gobbled burger frozen pizza and large bowl of ice cream it wa see food eat food thomas saidthe living heart foundation ha examined several thousand former player since it wa formed in with financial backing from the nfl player union about twothirds of those player not just linemen had a body mass index above which is considered moderately obese a third of those screened were at or above or significantly obese the index which is viewed a a general indication of weight relative to size doe not take into account muscle mass linemen have been getting heavier faster from to they have gained an average of threequarters of a pound to two pound a year about twice the average gain for all nfl player according to a study published in the journal of strength and conditioning researchanother study showed that the average weight of offensive linemen ballooned percent from pound in the s to pound in the s a the passing game evolved the consequence can be dire a study published in the american journal of medicine found that for every pound football player gained from high school to college or from college to the professional level the risk of heart disease rose percent compared with player whose weight changed little during the same periodplenty of linemen do lose weight the former linemen matt birk and nick hardwick shed dozen of pound after retiring and publicized their achievement thomas who retired last year after season with the brown gained roughly pound after

year but after reaching the top of that profession he is relishing doing something new and in some way even more highprofile than serving a chief cop on the biggest stage in american sport he now explains the intricacy of the rule book to ten of million of sport fan watching on televisionthe excitement of the unknown becoming a neophyte again at a very high level wa extremely challenging to me steratore saidsteratore ha made some of the most scrutinized and denigrated nfl call of the last decade he overturned a potential winning touchdown catch by detroit calvin johnson and a dez bryant catch for dallas in the playoff four year ago then last february he upheld disputed touchdown grab made by philadelphia corey clement and zach ertzcalvin johnson didnt catch it dez bryant didnt catch

roughingthepasser penalty against kansa city chief defensive tackle chris joneshe defended clete blakeman the referee who made the call and then stated plainly that blakeman got it wrong it a swing

repeatedly this week that vinovichs crew got the call wrong but also defended vinovich who told a pool reporter after the game that he had not seen the playsteratore explained that vinovichs specific responsibility on the play wa to watch the offensive line and the quarterback not a pas yard down the fieldif you turn your head when that ball leaf and that quarterback get hit at his knee or below and he laying there out and there is no flag it is a much more egregious mistake than this one steratore saidgerald austin a former referee and espn rule analyst for six season said part of the analyst job were harder than being a refereethere are seven official on the field each covering a specific area but a rule analyst must cover it all while analyst are watching the ball there could be a development across the field they are asked to comment on a few second later with limited time to watch a replayyour decision ha to be quicker and more on target in a shorter period of time austin saidsteratore said his job also involved educating viewer about the process of ruling on difficult call he quickly explains the situation and generally what the official are considering and then after a few replay he go over the specific thing they are looking at to make a callonly after he ha seen every relevant angle doe he say what the call should bethe greatest official in the world theyre in

division rival the baltimore raven brian billick the former raven coach would tell steratore he wanted him to referee every one of those gameshis reverse psychology wa that if it wa a play i might be more inclined to go his way for fear of what the public may think steratore saidbillick said his request wa mostly tongue in cheek though he thought it wa worth bringing up just to get him to think about it maybe hell pausethe referee for the super bowl will be john parry who wa promoted to his job in after vinovich temporarily retired because of health problem steratore know parry well of

september new orleans and los angeles had jockeyed for the conference top seed with one coaching mastermind named sean striving to duplicate the success of another no other matchup embodied the season

best in the league second remained to tie or even win the game goff who overcame a firstquarter interception to complete of pass for yard and a touchdown proceeded to direct the ram into fieldgoal

orchestrated that comeback without their pro bowl running back todd gurley zach schonbrunand the most accurate quarterback in nfl history is picked off in overtimebreess arm wa hit a he threw leaving a ball that hung in the air ram defender john johnson came down with the interception a he wa falling down on his back in saint territory los angeles can now win it with a field goal zach schonbrunhello overtime the ram got down to the yard line but the saint defense held firm and a yard field goal by greg zuerlein tied the game with second left the saint elected to kneel it to send it to the extra periodbut that nocall on the lewis play on the last drive continues to look worse and worse saint coach sean payton is still pleading his case to the referee and the fan are still booing hard to believe zach schonbrunsaints settle for a field goal to take a lead and give the ram back the ball with minute second left and one timeout but the saint and the fan were upset that ram cornerback robeycoleman hit tommylee lewis early on a pas out in the flat both player went up for the ball but coleman connected with lewis before the ball touched him fan are booing and from replay it certainly looked like the flag should have been thrown there that could have ended the game because the saint could have run down the clock before kicking a field goal once again an nfl playoff game could be decided by the referee zach schonbrunyou just knew the saint were going to try to take a shot downfield at some point theyve been thriving on their usual mix of underneath pass and creative screen but with time ticking down to the twominute warning brees finally uncorked a bomb to ted ginn jr who outleaped the safety lamarcus joyner for the ball yard downfield the saint are now in the red zone with three timeouts and le than two minute left zach schonbrunafter trailing the ram have climbed back to tie it with just about five minute remaining after starting the drive on their own yard line goff drove his team all the way down the field and a rush by cj anderson wa stopped on the yard line ram coach sean mcvay like to be aggressive but going for it on fourth down and passing up the chance to tie wa a bit too risky even for him so after a field goal we are all even zach schonbrunthat wa a huge series for the saint defense which forced the ram to punt from their own yard line and just when the ram looked to be seizing momentum again add in a personal foul against the ram on the punt and the saint will take over at the ram scott cacciolarams continue to gash the saint for big yardage play just a they did against the dallas cowboy last week brandin cook now ha yard receiving after a yard catch and run an end around by josh reynolds then went for yard all the way to the yard line setting up a touchdown pas to tyler higbee to make it after the score higbee immediately put his finger to his lip shhhhhhhh dont think the saint fan will listen though zach schonbrunso much for the ram momentum after they went threeandout on their opening series of the second half the saint took over and marched down the field their play yard drive culminated in a yard touchdown pas from brees to taysom hill the team thirdstring quarterback but really that drive wa all about alvin kamara the saint doeverything tailback kamara caught four pass for yard and ran once for yard sparking new orleans and the crowd is once again in a tizzy scott caccioladont count the ram out yet they turned up the defensive pressure on brees sacking him on consecutive play then two big throw by jared goff to brandin cook including a beautiful yard completion to the yard line have put the ram right back in it a touchdown run by gurley remember him make it a game at halftime zach schonbrunthat series wa the best possible sequence of event for the ram not only did gurley get involved with the touchdown run welcome back todd but the ram also absolutely silenced the crowd before halftime and dont forget the ram will get the ball to start the second half scott cacciolasomething to watch the ram have gone away from todd gurley their allpro running back since that early pas that wound up being an interception slipped through his hand cj anderson signed late in the regular season when gurley wa sidelined with a knee injury ha been getting the bulk of the carry in his place anderson and gurley were both terrific last weekend in the ram divisionalround victory over the dallas cowboy scott cacciolaspecial team are already a factor in this game which feature two of the best and most creative unit in the leagueon the ram last drive coach sean mcvay made the gutsy call to fake the punt and throw a pas on th and which finally gave the ram some offensive momentum the result wa a field goal to get on the board on the other side the saint special team were the most efficient in the nfl this season led by the wellrespected mike westhoff and they love to employ taysom hill in innovative way zach schonbrunif there one word to sum this game up so far it might be noise it is so loud inside this building and just to give saint fan a friendly nudge the game operation department here keep flashing a giant make noise sign on the jumbotron with flame licking all the letter noise of course is part of the strategy veteran in the press box who have been to many sport event here at the superdome are saying this is the loudest theyve heard it and the noise is clearly affecting the ram jared goff had the experience of playing against the saint here earlier this season but suffice it to say the atmosphere wa slightly more muted back in november than it is today scott cacciolafifteen thats the total yardage for the ram in the first quarter their lowest total for a quarter this season that doe not include a single first down and theyre facing another third down when the second quarter begin more alarming the crowd noise at the superdome caused the ram to commit a false start after they had just called a timeout because of the crowd noise zach schonbrunits starting to look like a nightmarish start for the ram in new orleansin the red zone for a third time already in the first quarter the saint brought their doeverything backup quarterback taysom hill in on third down but could not convert the runpass option play no matter new orleans brought brees back onto the field on th and from the yard line and he got the ram to jump offsideon the next play two ram defender ran into each other and brees found garrett griffin wide open in the end zone new orleanslos angeles look completely out of sort on defense but the saint have that effect on a lot of team zach schonbrunits probably worth noting the colossal difference in time of possession here so far while the ram have had the ball for a grand total of minute second the saint have had it for the ram defense is already working hard and probably did well to limit the saint to two field goal on their first two series goff and his offense could do the defense a huge favor by keeping the ball here for more than another threeandout scott cacciolaon the nfls radio broadcast they are reporting that ram quarterback jared goff wa having problem with the audio inside his helmet meaning he couldnt hear coach sean mcvay the ram are hoping that the issue is resolved scott cacciolaoh boy new orleans force a turnover a a dropped pas by todd gurley go right into the arm of saint linebacker demario davis on the ram own yard line it wa la first turnover in three game and it give new orleans a chance to take a commanding early start zach schonbrunit did not take long for drew brees to make a little history with his third completion of the saint opening drive he passed the great dan marino for sixth on the alltime postseason completion list with incidentally the ram made an unusual decision to defer after winning the coin toss giving the saint the ball to start a small gamble when brees is the opposing quarterback and this crowd is fired up the kid might refer to the superdome a lit all thing considered the ram were fortunate to get off the field after giving up just a field goal

change and stunning camera angle all aimed at getting the call right the decision came down to a simple fact the most important guy wa standing in the wrong place at the wrong time and nobody could do anything about itthose rule might change this offseason though in the past the nfl ha shown little appetite for making penalty reviewable because they are considered judgment call this mean that

borderline irrelevance he ha been brought in to reform an undisciplined defense and counterbalance adam gase the newly hired coach who at is one of the league youngest most innovative offensive

saint with williams a ringleader offered payouts to player who injured opponent according to a league investigation the scandal resulted in plenty of handwringing over the sport relationship with brutality when it wa trying to convince the public that it wa taking seriously the mounting concern about head injuriesin march williams received an indefinite suspension the harshest of the penalty doled out which included a oneyear suspension for saint coach sean payton williams wa reinstated in in the year since williams ha worked his way back into the defensive coordinator role seemingly without having lost much of his brashness or bravado on hbos hard knock training camp with the cleveland brown this past summer williams became something of a celebrity among brown supporter who took to his intensity and vulgar tirade williams liked to end defensive huddle with the phrase come get somehes not here to make you feel comfortable said the former linebacker jolonn dunbar who played for williams in new orleans and st louis he willing to ruffle your featherswilliams is indeed a throwback to the era of football coach a force of nature gas introduction to the jet wa judged by some a notably subdued but williams thunder into a locker room like a galein cleveland where he wa defensive coordinator for two season he warned parent about bringing young child to training camp because of his propensity to yell obscenity he admonished reporter for slouching in chair he trashtalked the matineeidol quarterback baker mayfielddunbar said practice were intensified by williams insistence that any loose ball be treated like a turnover at all timesanytime a ball hit the ground he want you to pick it up dunbar said anytime a ball is overthrown he want you to act like it wa an interception and return itdunbar added that player eventually became conditioned to go after the ballit strike some a just the sort of type a personality that can light a fire under the jet who struggled under coach todd bowlesthey need a guy that can come and crack the whip teach them football but also be very demanding said bart scott a former jet linebacker who is now a cohost of the cmb show on wfan he can teach them and give them the tool to be successful in different situationsthe jet have declined to make williams available for interview until after gas full staff ha been assembled gase also hired dowell loggains from the miami dolphin to be offensive coordinator and kept the specialteams coordinator brant boyerin a recent interview on a pro football talk podcast gase said he had known williams for more than a decadehe did his time gase said of williams and the scandal in new orleans he gotten a second chance he done it right he gone and worked extremely hard to do thing the right way and for me or anybody else to hold that over his head to me is wrongmany jet player expressed enthusiasm after williams wa hired safety jamal adam at the pro bowl in orlando said he had already been watching video of williams team on youtubehes the best in the business adam said ive had so many player hit me up to tell me how much im going to love coach greggone former player who may not share such sentiment is peyton manning who recommended gase his former offensive coordinator in denver to the jet williams once told a nashville radio station that he wanted his defender to put remember me hit on manning then the quarterback for the indianapolis coltswilliams will probably bring at least one significant change to the defensive scheme the jet have used a three down linemen four linebacker base defense since eric mangini arrived in but williams is known for his format which emphasizes speed rusher on the outside something the jet do not exactly have right nowthe team doe have more than million in cap space so there should be flexibility to acquire a defensive end or two to fit williams vision which relies on the blitztheyre going to be probably the most aggressive defense in the nfl dunbar said he going to bring pressure he going to manufacture pressurethe jet tried this approach under rex ryan who took them to two consecutive afc championship game it worked until it didnt ryan coached the jet for six year and wa fired after the season when he went too williams demanding personality will be an adjustment for some player dunbar said another difficulty is how much information he throw at his player so they understand more than just their role in the defense he want them to know the whole orchestra not just it partshe want his player to be more like coach on the field than just robotic player dunbar said he want them to play with instinct and be able to call what they feelto scott that is the type of coach the jet need controversy

minute of playing timethe tone of the opening drive wa set on the first new england play from scrimmage when michel sliced through a gaping hole in the middle of the kansa city front line for an yard gainthe patriot stuck to the ground to convert on essential third down play behind allpurpose running back james whitethe chief linebacker began sneaking toward the line of scrimmage and brady saw them changing a play in a presnap read and throwing over the middle to edelman for yardsand so went the catandmouse game with white backfield mate michel dashing for yard to kansa city yard line three play later from the yard line behind crushing block by gronkowski and fullback james develin michel leapt into the end zone for a new england leadafter the chief lost six yard on their initial possession the patriot next drive which began in chief territory wa nearly a efficientwhite plowed through hole in the chief defense and a welltimed shovel pas in the backfield to wide receiver cordarrelle patterson gained yard edelman caught another pas and soon the patriot were a yard from the kansa city goal line again but on a third down brady faked a handoff bent at the waist to hide the ball and popped up and lofted a quick pas toward the foot gronkowski breaking across the middlebrady did not see chief linebacker reggie ragland standing in the path of his throw ragland made the interception and the chief narrowly avoided falling behind by two touchdownsbut when the chief went on offense they continued to look out of sync and frustrated the patriot were successfully pressuring mahomes forcing him to flee the pocket and rush his throwsthe chief offense had only one first down near the midpoint of the second quarter when the patriot appeared to have mahomes corralled for a sack on a third down play mahomes instead slipped a tackle and fired a pas to watkinson the next play the chief fastest player tyreek hill got behind his defender for a yard reception suddenly it wa the patriot defense that seemed to be unsteady especially on the succeeding play when williams the chief running back wa left uncovered a he ran a pas route into the new england end zonein a costly mistake mahomes overthrew the wide open williams a sack of mahomes eventually moved the chief who would gain just yard offensively in the first half out of field goal rangeon their

chief by benjamin hoffmanrex burkhead surged in from two yard out to get the patriot a victory in overtime before the chief ever got a chance to posse the ballthirty nine second wa plenty of time for patrick mahomes the secondyear quarterback took his team yard on a pair of long pass and while he wasnt able to throw a touchdown pas on his third attempt he had gotten his team close enough for harrison butker to tie thing up with a yard field goalnew england will have just second and this game is almost undoubtedly headed to overtimethis game ha lived up to expectation rex burkhead blasted through the middle for a yard touchdown run and the patriot who seemed all but done in this game are now leading with just second remainingnew england went yard on six play and survived what appeared to be a kansa city interception that wa overturned a a result of a penaltyfor mahomes there is never a down or distance too far to rule him out but he ha a long way to go with almost no time to do itdamien williams raced up the middle for a yard score putting the chief up by with left in the afc championship gamethe chief drive went yard in five play and while it had many key moment for the kansa city offense it wa far more about mistake by the new england defense and jc jackson a rookie defensive back isnt going to be very popular if the patriot lose this gameearlier in the drive travis kelce had lost control the of the ball and donta hightower had recovered giving the patriot the ball and the lead with just over minute remaining a late flag came out and a defensive holding penalty on jackson had instead given kansa city a first downit wa just two play later that jackson committed a brutal pas interference penalty that gave kansa city yardstom brady now ha two minute and the patriot need a touchdownnot content to let the chief steal the game new england marched yard down the field with sony michel barreling his way into the end zone for a yard touchdown run with the extra point the patriot are now back on top with remaining in the gamekansas city defense had tightened up considerably on it last few try but this time around they once again fell prey to a series of short grinding play by the patriot on top of that new england wa able to take another off the clock extending it lead in time of possession to to kansa city the drive wa impressive overall but on what is proving to be a rough day for officiating especially in new orleans new england drive wa extended by an extremely questionable roughing the passer penalty against chris jones the play in which jones reached over brady shoulder and tapped his shoulder wa ruled on by an official who wa out of position to see what type of contact wa made between jones and bradythe chief have taken the leadgiven the ball in new england territory patrick mahomes needed just two play to put his team on top with a yard catchandrun to damien williams in which the running back took a floater of a pas from mahomes and sprinted past the entire patriot defense on his way into the end zonemahomes is up to three touchdown pass in the second half and this time he capitalized on a tom brady mistake the interception to daniel sorensen to give his team it first leadin a wild turn of event the chief lost a turnover thanks to a replay review but then got the ball back thanks to an interception by daniel sorensenit had briefly looked a if kansa city had recovered a muffed punt a lengthy replay review determined the ball never made contact with julian edelmans hand giving new england the ball at it own yard linethe various replay appeared to show the ball clear edelmans hand despite some odd movement in his thumbsconsidering the chief had come up with a huge stop on thandinches on new england previous drive the muffed punt wa pushing the momentum of the game decidedly in kansa city favor while having to give the ball back had to be a blow to morale sorensen interception got the chief right back into itpatrick mahomes threw four touchdown pass in the second half of the chief loss to the patriot in week and he already up to two in the second half of this game his latest a yarder to damien williams ha kansa city trailing new england the scoring drive went yard on nine play with the biggest highlight coming on a yard catchandrun by williams and a brutal pas interference penalty in which new england jc jackson mugged travis kelce in the end zone setting the chief up with a standgoal from new england yard lineon top of those play mahomes showed some toughness on the drive stepping out of the way of a sack attempt and racing for a yard gain plowing into patrick chung at the end of the play and then picking up a first down on a sneak up the middlea few play later mahomes saved the drive yet again with a sidearm throw to sammy watkins for a first down the play after that wa the huge run down the sideline by williams in which the running back spun his way down the field past new england defendersthe touchdown seemed all but inevitable once the chief reached the red zone but the pas interference call against jackson made it nice and easy for mahomes to roll out and hit williams with the short passthe patriot lead is up to point after stephen gostkowski connected on a yard field goal attemptnew england had to go just yard to set up the score after having held tight against kansa city offense with the chief backed up inside their own to start their previous drive a a result new england started the drive on the yard linethe chief defense acquitted itself fairly well on the latest scoring drive holding tight on a rdand but thanks to the short field that didnt matterin what could be turning into a game of field position the patriot may have just given themselves a big advantage despite the team having traded puntskansas city failed to do anything on it second possession of the second half with patrick mahomes and his teammate going just yard on five play but the drive had started at kansa city yard line thanks to a brutal sequence in which tyreek hill cost himself around yard by running backward in hope of finding a seam to exploit and a blocking penalty tacking on another yard lossas a result new england will be getting the ball at the yard line still up kansa city wasted no time getting on the scoreboard in the second half needing just to get a yard touchdown pas from patrick mahomes to travis kelce the chief now trail thing started slowly with damien williams picking up a combined yard on a short reception and a short run but mahomes saw an opportunity to do some damage on third down and he rolled out to his right before launching the ball downfield to sammy watkins for a yard reception that caught the patriot second sleepingclearly energized by the play mahomes threw aggressively to kelce in the end zone and a he ha done so many time before kelce wa able to control the ball in traffic and reward his quarterback faitha mostly quiet first half ended with the chief going out meekly a patrick mahomes momentarily lost the ball on a stripsack fumble before he recovered it and simply knelt on the ball to send his team to the locker room down by while the score is still relatively close new england ha dictated the tone of the game the patriot have exploited the chief frontseven with a series of short pass and run not allowing kansa city top passrushers any time to get to tom brady and new england defense ha mostly contained the chief offensethat ha resulted in a huge disparity in playing time with new england offense holding the ball for compared to for the chiefsthere wa a brief glimpse of what mahomes is capable of on two completion in the second quarter in which he wa able to deal with the new england passrush and find his receiver deep downfield but that drive produced nothing after a sack pushed kansa city out of field goal rangebeyond those two throw mahomess pass have been off the mark and damien williams ha gotten nowhere with the running game the chief were outgained to in total yardagethis year chief scored the thirdmost point in nfl history so it is hard to declare them out of any game they play regardless of the score but kansa city coach andy reid will need to heavily adjust his strategy on both side of the ball if he want to get back into the gamein the one small bit of good news for the chief they will receive the ball to start the second halfthe second quarter had nearly ground to a halt thanks to a series of punt but new england woke up in the final minute of the first half with tom brady finding phillip dorsett for a yard touchdown reception that along with the extra point ha new england up the patriot latest long drive went yard on eight play and ha left kansa city with just enough time to run one or two play or kneel on the ball to end the halfthe chief defense after failing a series of test to start the game came up huge on rdandgoal with reggie ragland intercepting tom brady pas attempt to rob gronkowski thus stealing some momentum back for kansa cityup until that point the patriot had seemingly been doing anything they wanted using run and short pass to expose a frontseven that is good at rushing the passer but far worse at putting up with the quick hit that the patriot can accomplish with their small wide receiver and their talented group of running backsin all the drive went yard on play but the chief were able to escape still trailing by new england had gotten the ball back quickly thanks to a fairly inept first drive by the chief offense in which kansa city generated minus yard a a result of a sack of patrick mahomes that came after he had his first two pas attempt of the game fall incomplete the only positive movement of the drive for the chief came thanks to a yard run by damien williams which he followed with a yard loss and a yard penalty by the patriot defensenow mahomes will get a second chance to show what he can doit wa clear coming in that this game would be a tough test for the chief defense and the unit looked almost helpless on an opening drive by the patriot in which new england marched yard on play

make a boatload of money ten of million of u will reflexively tune in and well find rare common ground over how cheesy the halftime show is but are we believer anymore will we really see the winner a the winner or just a the charmed survivor of a grossly tarnished process be it the new england patriot or the los angeles ram the team will have an asterisk after it name and that asterisk is a big fat sign of the time im referring of course to the miserable officiating thats arguably the reason the patriot beat the kansa city chief and the ram beat the new orleans saint leading to the matchup in this coming sunday seasonfinale game the ram in particular were blessed by the referee who failed to note and penalize a glaring case of pas interference in the climactic minute i neednt describe what happened footage of it ha been replayed a extensively and analyzed a exhaustively a the zapruder filmand it ha prompted an intensity of protest a magnitude of soul searching and a depth of cynicism that go well beyond the crime in question thats where the feeling about the super bowl and the mood of america convergego beyond the headline and behind the curtain with frank brunis candid reflection on politics culture higher education and more every week sign up for his newsletter were still reeling from a presidential election that wa colored if not corrupted by unfair advantage undue meddling and disrespected rule and here we have a super bowl thats colored if not corrupted by unfair advantage undue meddling and disrespected rule many fan are rejecting it legitimacy sound familiar there are conspiracy theory afootamericans are so down on and distrustful of major institution and authority that were primed to declare their fraudulence and the national football league and the super bowl are on the receiving end of that theyre not fresh target not by any stretch but this time weve lost all sense of perspective the missed passinterference call in the clash between the ram and saint wa certainly egregious but every football game is a compendium of good and bad break luck is always a factor and often the deciding one the saint had homefield advantage and their fan created enough noise to addle and even paralyze the ram on offense the saint also made error galore blowing the possibility of a lead too commanding to be erased by poor officiating on a recent episode of his podcast the sport commentator bill simmons methodically broke down the game en route to this conclusion i really thought the ram were better he added that if thats a neutral field i think the ram winthat the ram did win with an assist from somnambulistic referee ha not gone over well in new orleans the louisiana governor wrote a letter of condemnation to nfl commissioner roger goodell the new orleans city council is considering a formal resolution declaring the outcome an injustice and demanding that the nfl thoroughly review it rule one of louisiana senator ha called for a

referee in the ramssaints contest live in southern california wa a secret prorams bias at work there ha also been angst about the speed of player now the intricacy of the rule book the ease of instant replay and what all of that portends what if this wa the moment that blew all of our commonly held notion about officiating to piece and made u really truly question whether the game in it current state can really be adequately overseen by referee at all asked conor orr epically on sport illustrateds websiteon deadspincom tom ley went further writing that football today requires you to sit on your couch for three hour and spend the whole time questioning if what you saw is really what you saw the referee the videotape and the fan have conflicting perception and wind up telling diverging story not just about the passinterference bungle but about a roughingthepasser penalty on a chief player who to my eye did nothing more than fail to blow tom brady an air kiss at the end of the play that decision too wa possibly gamechanging graduating brady to a super bowl in which he may not belongfootball ha never been entirely fair any more than life is in the past the patriot were caught

center of the room next to a couple of yellow duffel bag labeled playoff defensive tackle david onyemata pulled on black jean with designer rip that revealed skinned kneeswhen running back mark ingram wa asked for his reaction to the moment that had freshly defined the nfc championship on sunday afternoon he stared at the floor in front of him and shook his head when he finally spoke it came out a whisperi cant say any word he saidthe topic of the day and one that will probably linger like a noxious cloud over footballcrazed new orleans for year wa a noncall that had helped the los angeles ram secure their super bowl berth with a overtime victory over the saint on a cold day outside the crowd left the building bubbling with rage most of the player tried to exercise at least some restraintnothing you can do about it now wide receiver tommylee lewis saidthe play in question happened late in the fourth quarter of a tie game on thirdand at the ram saint quarterback drew brees lofted a pas toward lewis who had run a wheel route out of the backfield toward the right sideline but well before the ball arrived lewis wa clobbered by cornerback nickell robeycoleman who had his back to brees and to the airborne ball and later acknowledged that yes he had probably committed a passinterference penaltyi just know i got there before the ball got there and i whacked his as robeycoleman saidthe only problem the official closest to the play did not penalize robeycoleman for pas interference it came a a shock to just about everyone including robeycoleman who recalled hearing the official yell incomplete per league rule judgment call like pas interference are not subject to video reviewi got up and i looked around and no laundry robeycoleman said referring to the absence of a yellow penalty flaghad the official thrown one the saint would have been awarded a first down allowing them to run down the clock before attempting a winning field goal or even scoring a touchdown the ram probably never would have gotten the ball backinstead the saint had to kick a field goal on fourth down that put them ahead by with minute second to play in regulation it turned out to be more than enough time for the ram to march down the field and make a yard field goal that sent the game to overtime los angeles eventually won the game on a yard field goal by greg zuerleinin his postgame news conference saint coach sean payton said he had spoken by phone immediately after the game with alberto riveron the nfls senior vice president for officiating and the league officethe first thing al said when i got on the phone we messed it up payton said adding it wa simple they blew the call it should never have not been a call they said not only wa it interference it wa helmet to helmet two callsit wa the second straight season that a saint playoff run ended in heartbreak last season it wa a divisionalround loss to the minnesota viking on a yard touchdown reception a time expired a fluke play that seemed impossible to replicate in term of soulcrushing consequencesbut then there wa sunday afternoonthats tough to swallow brees said i think there were plenty of time throughout the season where there call that go against you go for you or they miss or they didnt obviously in a situation like that where it seemed like everybody in the world saw it it toughtough too because of the saint realistic super bowl aspiration they finished the regular season tied for the best record in the nfc and the ram were coming to their building where the crowd tends to be inhospitable to opponent at best and downright ruthless at worst the noise wa so bad for the ram on sunday that quarterback jared goff had to put tape over the ear hole of his helmet so he could hear the audio coming from his coachpayton though ha had a contentious relationship with the league and an errant call which the nfl admitted making in such a crucial moment seems sure to add to an already robust sense of injustice in new orleansmuch of that agita stem from the socalled bountygate scandal in which the saint coaching staff wa found to have rewarded player who injured opponent a a part of the fallout payton wa barred by the league from coaching during the season and some of the scar are still evident all these year lateron sunday defensive end cameron jordan suggested that the referee were biased against the saintswe know for a long time that we dont get call that way jordan said adding a far a ive known we havent had referee that go gungho for the saint weve got to put ourselves in the best position so were not able to be touchedwill it haunt that ref who care will it haunt this team this will be something that will be another defining moment for usa for robeycoleman the ram

donald but waufle wa undeterred he had long prized speed over size and from the start he viewed donald a an outlier grading him a the best prospect he had seen since his first season coaching in the nfl donald generated so much power that he reminded waufle of the russian boxer ivan drago in rocky iv who punched a computerized meter with such force that dragos manager remarked whatever he hit he

sack in a season since the statistic wa first tracked in came from defender who didnt play tackle according to the elia sport bureaurandle never quite reached that total topping out at but contemporary like laroi glover and warren sapp did and randle viewed them and himself a misfit fueled by the perception that they werent fast enough to play linebacker big enough to play offensive line or nimble enough to play running backacross season with minnesota and seattle randle amassed the most sack by a defensive tackle in nfl history by destroying quarterback and game plan much a donald doe now just with le time to get to the quarterback donald had a leagueleading pressure according to pro football focus the next closest player fletcher cox of philadelphia had when you get that interior pressure they cant run the sweep the center cant pull randle said when youre in the inside you may not get there but youre in the quarterback face and he cant see because the pressure there he see you and he more conscious of you youre right there in front of himwhen watching donald randle notice how his foot hand and eye work in concert with a first step so quick that it can be

yard away donald must sprint to grab it before it bounce a second time go on try itto increase his strength donald work with dave andrew the strength and conditioning coach at pitt who called him a genetic mutant and a ball of dynamite andrew challenge him with exercise in which he provides donald with resistance throughout the entire movement to isolate a particular muscle groupits no different

like in the weight room like good luck i walk out in a full sweatdonald ha long been strong and thick a an adolescent he would wake before dawn to lift weight with his father but donald wa real chunky brown said when he first encountered him a a junior at penn hill high schoolthat season greg gattuso then the defensive line coach at pitt attended a penn hill game to scout one of donalds teammate he

regional rivalriesunder the plan currently being considered most match in the tournament would still be held in qatar which won the right to a team event and continues to prepare for one but other game would take place in kuwait and oman a part of a broader middle eastern world cup infantinos expansion would not send game to country that are currently leading a political and economic blockade of qatar like the united arab emiratesinfantino elected fifa president in and seeking reelection to a fouryear term in june ha been among the biggest proponent of an expanded world cup that through increased place for fifas member association and increased sponsorship revenue could prove popular among country that rarely get to compete in the tournamenta final call on the idea wa expected to be made next week when fifas governing council meet in miami but infantino ha decided to move the final decision to fifas annual congress in june where he is standing unopposed for reelectionshould qatar agree to the change it consent is required and should logistical challenge be overcome infantino would most likely seek the approval of fifas member federation a grouping long known for rubberstamping policy favored by the president he had said previously that the decision would be taken up by the smaller fifa council which governs the sport worldwidefifa and qatar world cup organizer did not comment on the matterprivately though some senior member of the organizing committee who have been working on the event since qatar controversially secured it a decade ago are opposed to sharing the competition and frustrated that it may yet happen qatar final position on the matter will be defined by it ruler who may see political advantage in agreeing to include specific neighborswhile infantino ha suggested that sharing game with qatar neighbor would help heal rift in the region a fifaled group conducting a feasibility study ha concluded that it would be impractical to include the

knowledge of the talksinfantino ha pushed an expansion of the world cup at every opportunity in recent year despite setback along the way he pulled the issue from the agenda at last year fifa congress

forge ahead to secure the expanded format which ha been adopted for the world cup and beyond qatar organizer have said since last summer that they will reserve judgment on a team tournament until a comprehensive study ha been carried outinfantino ha vacillated when asked about the intensity of his push for a team world cup veering between sporting justification that center on growing interest in the sport and politically hopeful one that suggest it could ease political tension in the regionthere are tension in this particular region and it up to their respective leader to deal with that but maybe it easier to talk about a joint football project than more complicated thing infantino said in january if it can help all the people in the gulf and all the country in the world develop football

advertisementsupported bythe league didnt actually try to steal nashville gorgeous cherry tree but it sure felt that wayby margaret renklcontributing opinion writernashville last saturday morning all across the city nashville resident woke up to news that seemed almost orwellian or if not orwellian then at least onionian city official had decided to cut down mature cherry tree in full bloomon le than hour noticebecause the national football league asked them tothe cherry tree in question line downtown first avenue north which run along the cumberland river and front riverfront park site of the city grandest celebration later this month that park will be where the nfl hold it annual draft an event that seems to require a giant stage the like of which nashville and possibly all of tennessee maybe even the whole country ha never seen nashville otherwise known a music city is pretty well set with stage but apparently none of them is sufficiently grand to suit the nfl better to chop down a bunch of living tree and build an even grander stage and all for a threeday event that may be moved indoors anyway perhaps youve heard of april showersthe irony here abound just last october nashville mayor david briley announced a major initiative to plant tree by an effort to replace the roughly tree the city is losing each year to it explosive growth but the tree in question here hadnt been lost at all they are mature yoshino cherry tree the same tree that bloom so extravagantly along the mall in washington during the national cherry blossom festival and nashville own cherry blossom festival which national geographic rank a one of the best in the country is set for april le than two week after news broke that of the tree on first avenue north would be destroyedthe optic of this plan to kill the cherry tree are bad let kill some living tree so that we can put up a temporary stage to promote an organization that profit from a sport widely understood to cause grievous longterm damage to the brain of it player those airy pink blossom with petal that float on the wind and fall on our shoulder like a benediction let cut them down for the sake of a blood sportnashvillians erupted with fury conservation group like the nashville tree foundation and the nashville tree conservation corp mobilized their follower who sent up a great alarm that quickly rippled across facebook and twitter and from there to local and then national news outletsa changeorg petition posted at oclock on saturday morning racked up thousand of signature more than by sunday afternoon and city official were scrambling to respond at first announcing that the tree would be dug up and relocated in the city and then reconfiguring the plan itself so that only tree would be moved leaving all the tree on first avenue itself in place in our own brand promise we talk about protecting the authenticity of the city butch spryidon the chief executive of the nashville convention and visitor corp said in a public apology on sunday i think it a balance i think it a good reminder of that balance lesson learned hard lesson learnedwell no a lesson truly learned would have meant moving that stage mature tree can with great effort be transplanted successfully under ideal circumstance but these are not ideal circumstance their root lie under a public walkway paved with brick a location that make it difficult to remove enough of the root structure for successful relocation and transplanting a tree once it ha already begun to bud out in spring just before the stress of summer heat make the challenge to it survival even greater moving these tree in other word is just a more expensive way to kill themwe have bigger problem in this city than the loss of cherry tree our school board is completely dysfunctional our state legislature in thrall to the koch network is energetically working to undercut every progressive law nashville pass a recent investigation by the tennessean the city daily newspaper revealed that tennessee ha surreptitiously cut child from state healthinsurance roll during the past two year more than of those kid live in nashvilleand it not a though the cherry tree are stately oak that go back hundred of year theyre ornamental not shade tree and their ideal habitat is japan not tennessee the benefit of a robust tree canopy in the urban core are well known by now tree mitigate the effect of greenhouse gas cool city sidewalk and street reduce energy cost for building absorb and filter storm water the cherry tree at riverfront park provide those benefit no doubt but there are many native tree that could do that work much better equally beautifully and with a longer life expectancywhen the nfl draft wa held in dallas last year it inspired some million in visitor spending according to the nashville convention and visitor corp so it easy to see why city official gave the cherry tree so little thought these people are not villain they arent sitting in a bunker plotting to steal nashville tree they arent thinking about tree at all theyre thinking about landing a deal to bring a bunch of spending money to downtown nashville a city with a cashflow problem so troubling that last year it reneged on a promised costofliving increase for city employee mayor brileys proposed budget for the fiscal year restores those raisesbut sometimes good intention can be a harmful a villainy there is no authenticity to the city left in downtown nashville anymore lower broad is a neon wasteland of rooftop bar and pedal tavern and motorized scooter and

good yearfor the third time in five season no pac team made the college football playoff the conference had just three entrant in the ncaa men basketball tournament and all of them bowed out in the first round former athletic director publicly criticized the league office for being out of touch there wa even a report that a conference official inappropriately intervened in a video replay review during a crucial football gamethe pac football champion washington played ohio state in the rose bowl on tuesday losing by and although that game remains valuable for many pac fan in term of heritage and tradition and for the conference in term of money it nonetheless represents another endofseason consolation game for the league which house the traditional power southern california and more recent contender like stanford oregon and utahat the root of these travail is moneyas the other four power conference especially the big ten and the southeastern conference have struck lucrative medium deal to infuse their member with revenue in recent year the pac ha failed to keep up thats despite a footprint that includes four of the country largest medium market including the secondlargest los angeles since larry scott wa hired a commissioner in pac revenue ha grown to million from million and the average amount each member school receives from the conference ha nearly quadrupled but compared with the other four power conference the pac still lag behind it wa last in the amount of money it distributed to member in and second to last in it will likely soon be last

no question about itwithout the same financial resource a their competitor many pac college have struggled to compete when it come to hiring the top coach building the glitzy facility and recruiting the star player that yield greater success it a virtuous cycle better player better medium deal more money through the conference more money to spend on your program and coach and all the accouterment that go along with a good program said warren zola a sport business professor at boston college carroll school of managementthe financial shortfall is largely the product of a bet that scott a former captain of the harvard tennis team and the pac made seven year ago while negotiating a series of multibilliondollar medium right agreement and starting a conference networkunlike the commissioner of other major college conference scott decided to buck a trend with his conferenceowned sport network by opting not to partner with a traditional medium company fox for instance owns percent of the big ten network instead scott kept the pac network and it affiliate independentthis ha meant forgoing what would likely have been hundred of million of dollar over the past several year in right fee if the pac had partnered with a traditional medium company or renegotiated it current deal more in tune with the rising market for live sport right the pac is also paying ten of million of dollar to run a cable network out of it own pocket and ha limited it distribution option by forgoing the negotiating clout that come with partnering with a major broadcasterall of this in exchange for retaining percent ownership in the venturein it looked a if scott might have made a good bet the pac sold most of it marquee football and basketball game to fox and espn for about billion over year more than quadrupling what the two company had been paying and setting a record for the richest conference contract but that arrangement ha since been eclipsed by tv deal for other league last year for instance the big ten announced a new deal also with fox and espn worth nearly the same amount a the pac deal billion for half the year six so even a the market for college sport right rise significantly the pac longterm deal effectively locked it into that rate until the arrangement expires in scott insisted that the conference would soon be in a position to surpass it competitor since the other league have deal that stretch into the s a windfall scott predicted is all but inevitableour bet is that by not extending our right or year now come the wisdom of this approach will be evident scott saidthe pac lived up to it selfappointed moniker during the school year winning the most championship over all of any league for the th straight year with a total of title in sport including men baseball and woman gymnastics and tennis with three national title already this fall it will likely do the same this school yearhowever title in volleyball and water polo do not pay the bill and in the sport that do football and men basketball the conference of the trojan and john wooden ha slippedin absolute term the pac is nowhere near the poor house since scott took over what wa then the pac in the conference revenue ha grown to million from million and the average annual perschool payout to million from millionbut big ten member anticipate receiving more than million from the conference this fiscal year because of a new television agreement sec member get roughly million from the conference the pac will most likely soon be last among the five major conference in the average annual amount received by conference member also trailing the big and the atlantic coast conference after the acc network owned by espn launch next yearmore money would come in handy washington state athletic department owes million after borrowing heavily to renovate it football stadium cal ha pledged to subsidize more than half the million in debt it athletic department incurred for facility constructionsalaries for the pac head football and men basketball coach lag those of their peer according to usa today database in football washington chris petersen the bestpaid coach in the conference is th over all four conference head coach make le than louisiana state defensive coordinator doe in basketball where salary generally are smaller league head coach are paid more competitively although big name in the acc the big ten and the big tend to make more than their counterpart in the packevin blue the athletic director at californiadavis who wa previously a senior associate athletic director at stanford said the sec and the big ten are setting the market for coaching salariesseveral of the conference former athletic director have publicly accused scott of being more concerned with pleasing his boss university president and chancellor than supporting the director themselves who are ostensibly more in touch with the business end of college athletics one of the pac biggest challenge is geography college sport are a fundamentally easier sell in the vast space of the midwest and the south than they are in the sun and snowkissed city and landscape of the westthere are other part of the country where it doesnt matter who your team is playing against youre going to fill a seat stadium scott said i dont have one school like thatsimilarly several of scott critic complain that the league medium deal requires frequent friday night and late saturday football game which can be tougher for fan to attend league coach including petersen have raised this issue but changing that is likely impossible given that the conference university are in the mountain and pacific time zone and roughly seven in television viewer in the united state live in the central or eastern time zonesif you want to get revenue at the same level then youve got to have kickoff in east coast prime time said lee berke a sport medium consultant and unless your school are located there they will never be in that positiongiven those disadvantage the pac and it eponymous tv network have tried to lean into the conference superiority in a wide range of olympic and nonrevenue sport beyond football and basketball the national pac network and it six regional affiliate show about event a year almost double the big ten networkwe have a network that allows u to project our identity and the full breadth of our sport said michael crow the longserving president of arizona state who lettered in track and field at iowa state crow is one of three pac president or chancellor remaining from the group that hired scott in it fantastic that woman volleyball and softball and athlete profile are going out across the whole western united state on a network we controlbut although it is now in it fifth year the pac network face difficulty reaching viewer it ha never been carried by directtv which delivers television to about million household and is the provider of choice for many bar

nationwide according to snl kagan a business research firm compared with million for the sec network and million for the big ten network revenue follows accordingly the pac network generated about million for each of the conference college last year while big ten school received around four time a much we absolutely recognize we are taking a bolder and different path than everyone else scott said the safest would be to do what everyone else ha done take a partner in your network extend your right to instead the pac hope it ha an ace in the hole come it will be the only major conference with all of it right up for grab a moment perhaps of rare leveragescott speculated that in addition to traditional television broadcaster like espn fox cbs and nbc digital company will compete to buy the pac right he namechecked just about all of them amazon facebook apple google netflix dazn and espncome the wisdom of this approach will be evident he said there no guarantee but thats the bet that weve made the promise of future rich can be cold comfort for pac university during their presentday strugglesi get it said steve patterson a former arizona state athletic director the coach ha to win

follows repeated failure by infantino to force the proposal through fifas governing council but if they are approved they would represent the biggest change to soccer in a generation and their

sunday in an afc wildcard playoff gamein the week leading up to sunday contest the charger dissected the videotape of the raven dec triumph in los angeles until every play and more important the

advertisementsupported bythe admission scandal involved lie about sport exploit that should have been simple to detect if someone had bothered to look by matthew futterman and nailajean meyersthe ruse wa oddly simple since college coach can often recommend more athlete to the admission department than a team need why not buy a few slot from the coach and sell them to parent desperate to get their child into the most selective universitiesperhaps the most remarkable thing about william singer scheme wa how easily he could have been found out with a handful of keystroke or maybe a phone call admission officer could have discovered that applicant were simply posing a athlete then it might have been discovered that a purported polevaulter had probably never touched a pole that a long snapper had stopped playing football that a supposedly fast swimmer wasnt fast at all indeed the doctored photograph used to support claim of athletic ability are pretty unconvincing yet a simple a it

one usc coach named in the case have been fired in heinel presented the son of a medium executive named elisabeth kimmel to uscs subcommittee for athletic admission the son wa supposedly a threeyear varsity letterwinner in track and field and one of the top polevaulters in californiahis application sailed through gaining approval on oct even though the boy high school had no record of his ever taking part in the pole vault this wa apparently familiar territory for kimmel who the document said had used singer to gain admission to georgetown for her daughter a a tennis player her daughter didnt play a single match for the hoya during her four year at the school in the case of her son kimmel expressed concern that he wa supposed to register with the ncaa and for him to do that his high school wa going to have to send his record that might be a problem kimmel is said to have told singer because her son guidance counselor knew he wa not a polevaulter eventually kimmel figured out how to send the paperwork to the ncaa herself but another hiccup occurred when kimmels son appeared on campus his adviser asked him about his athletic exploit the boy who wa not in on the scheme according to his mother told the adviser that he had no idea what she wa talking about and that there had to have been some mistake according to kimmel the adviser said she wa going to check into it a of

tennis team on sept the university announced on wednesday that center had been firedmarci palatella the chief executive of a liquor distribution company in burlingame calif wa looking for a way to get

last year i made him a long snapper singer saidi love it mcglashan replied he wa pound long snapper singer saidi love it i love it mcglashan said that is so funnyfor mcglashan singer opted for a different strategy since the long snapper ruse had just been used mcglashans son played lacrosse but usc did not have a lacrosse team so the boy wa described a a kicker even though his high school had

high school field and played game at boston university harvard university boston college and fenway park with the aflnfl merger in the patriot needed a sizable stadium a a permanent home and after talk with boston city leader repeatedly broke down billy sullivan the team owner welcomed an offer from bay state raceway which donated land next to it facility for a seat stadiumthe patriot won their first game at the stadium in although thousand of ticket holder never saw a single play because they were stuck for the entirety of the game in gridlock traffic that crammed route the only access road to the stadiumshortly after the first game the local health board closed schaefer stadium because of malfunctioning toilet various solution were tried including an exercise that enlisted hundred of volunteer to flush all of the stadium toilet simultaneously a tactic referred to a super flush in the local news medium fan came up with another name for the site the toilet bowlit wa a nightmare at time jack authelet the foxborough town historian said the stadium would be closed it would get a reprieve for one game and then there would be another closing another lastminute reprieve would allow a game to be played then it would close again this went on week after week when the game did go on the crowd drank heavily so much so that foxborough prohibited the stadium from hosting monday night football because of the tumult that ensued after dark and when the patriot were not playing the stadium hosted dozen of rock concert where pervasive drug and alcohol use caused nearby hospital to fill with patientsfoxborough with a pastoral common at it center wa wondering what it had gotten itself into but over time and with some prudent strategizing the traffic problem diminished restriction on event were imposed to make them safer and calmer the sullivan family lost control of the team and the stadium wa renamed foxboro stadium not foxborough and by the businessman robert k kraft had bought the team kraft knew he needed a modern stadium and in seriously flirted with taking the patriot to hartford eventually a deal wa struck to build what is now gillette stadium next to the site of the

event at gillette stadium which amount to million to million annually according to the town manager william keegan that total is at least doubled by other tax generated by the patriot presence in town

outside of boston tend to loathe the city team boston fan are quite happy with the tradeoff title in team season of franchise won a titlenew york in the s is still probably the best setting for a baseball fan think of the allstar lineup that could be formed with player only from the city three team willie may jackie robinson mickey mantle yogi berra gil hodges sandy koufax and on and onbeyond baseball the picture is more mixed the knicks won a title in and the giant won one in but the giant also lost five title game during this span and the ranger did not win one at all in baseball

on what proved to be the decisive drive in the patriot victoryit wa a year defined by offensive brilliance but at atlanta mercedesbenz stadium the game turned into a defensive slugfest defined largely by the game puntersneither team had reached the red zone until midway through the fourth quarter but brady looking to get something going twice exploited a coverage mismatch on gronkowski completing pass of and yard to his big tight end which set up sony michels yard touchdown run that put new england up to staythe throwback connection between quarterback and tight end proved to be too much for los angeles on a day when coach sean mcvays highlightreel offense wa forced to punt on it first eight possession of the game and time overall and wa limited to just total yardsbrady finished the day

mentally and physically poopedin what would prove to be a crushing blow to the ram the patriot were able to follow up sony michels touchdown with a turnover a jared goff wa intercepted by stephon gilmore late in the fourth quarter allowing new england to slow the game down and walk away with a victoryfor brady the win gave him a sixth super bowl ring breaking a tie with the hall of fame defensive end charles haley for the most by an individual player and it tied the patriot with the pittsburgh steelers for the most by any teamheres how the patriot won their sixth title the patriot just needed to chew up clock and they did that and more reeling off yard on nine play taking up minute and second and increasing their lead with a yard field goal by stephen gostkowski they now lead with remaining in the gamethe key play on the drive included a yard run by sony and a yard run by rex burkheadthe ram will receive the ball but down by point with no timeouts they would need to score immediately execute an onside kick and then score againpossibly inspired by new england touchdown the ram began racing down the field with a series of long play but after jared goffs pas to brandin cook just barely fell incomplete at the goal line goff tried to challenge the new england defense on a second consecutive play and he paid for it when stephone gilmore wa easily able to step in front of the pas for an interceptionthe patriot now have the lead and the ball with remaining in the gamebill pennington tremendous anticipation by stephon gilmore on the interception goff tried to go to cook in the same spot a the previous play that nearly resulted in a touchdown but gilmore wa staring at goff the entire play he all but turned his back and ignored cook when goffs pas fluttered gilmore watched it into his hand the whole waytom brady needed to get something going and rob gronkowski wa happy to oblige two connection between the future hall of famers led to the game first touchdown which wa scored on a yard run by sony michel the patriot now lead the drive started with brady taking advantage of blown coverage by samson ebukam to set up an yard catch by gronkowski just three play later brady went to gronk again this time for a yard gain that ended with the supersized tight end sliding to a stop just yard short of the end zonefrom there it wa fairly simple a michel ha been almost unstoppable at the goal line in the postseason and he went into the end zone easilybill pennington the ram desperately need a sustained offensive drive their defense is exhaustedthe ram managed to have a nineplay drive generate just yard a a result of penalty and johnny hekker punted for a ninth time this game ha surely been terrific for hekkers parent a he is up to punting yard but for everyone else it ha been remarkably frustrating to watch a neither team ha been into the red zone yetat this point it is seeming like the game will come down to a turnover generating point rather than either offense suddenly waking up though with either squad point could suddenly accumulate quicklyif you like punter this game is greatafter the patriot picked up a first down by way of a defensive holding penalty they got a second on an entertaining yard run by sony michel in which the rookie running back bounced off several defender before being brought downmichel picked up another yard on a pair of carry to close out the third quarter and then on the first play of the fourth quarter tom brady pas attempt to james white fell incomplete setting up yet another puntthere have been punt so fargreg zeurlein just barely lived up to his legatron nickname tying the game with a yard field goal that wa not one of his signature booming kick but did enough to get over the crossbar the game is now tied the ram offense had gotten the ball back quickly thanks to some terrific defensive work from marcus peter and they picked up a first down with a short throw to josh reynolds and a run by cj andersonencouraged by the conversion jared goff threw deep to brandin cook for a pictureperfect yard gaina run by anderson went for yard goff threw an incomplete pas off anderson back side to

safety had to come out of the game after appearing to break his right arm on gurleys second run of the drive he wa replaced by duron harmonafter an almost unwatchable first half this game can easily be taken over by either team in the second halffor the ram the key will be finding a way to run the ball todd gurley ha been almost entirely absent with no explanation and he and cj anderson have combined for just yard on seven carry that ha let new england defender pin their ear back and go after jared goff on every play the thirdyear quarterback ha not responded well completing of his pass with of his yard coming on a pas to robert wood that very likely wa an incompletionin the second half goff need to get back to his confident downfield throw letting brandin cook and robert wood break off some big play and if the running game cant help establish that room goff will simply have to get the ball out fasterfor the patriot running the ball more would help but they could improve simply by having the ram regress to the mean on defense marcus peter aqib talib and nickell robeycoleman have all played great game thanks in part to the ram putting pressure on brady but the los angeles defense had to spend nearly minute on the field in the first half and both peter and robeycoleman are prone to mistake if they are challenged repeatedlythe ram definitely qualify a more frustrated a they failed to score any point despite generating an interception a missed field goal and a turnover on down but with how close new england ha tended to stay to their opponent in super bowl the missed field goal by stephen gostkowski in the first quarter could easily come back to haunt new englandafter a lackluster first half to the super bowl halftime show headliner maroon took the stage a giant m stretching yard across the field to a barrage of firework and flame unfortunately the million fan at home werent given a respite from the game mediocritythe highlight of the show came about halfway through when a drum line and choir joined maroon lead singer adam levine to belt out the hit girl like you at home the highlight for many wa the spongebob squarepants interludein theory travis scott and big boi were maroon s costars scott rapped sicko mode heavily censored on television early in the show and big boi appeared late in a classic car wearing a fur jacket he sang the outkast hit the way you move with levine playing the role of andre in practice they only sang one song a piece levine even joined big boi unfortunately playing the role of big bois outkast costar andre it wa truly the adam levine show a he ran through all of maroon s hit harder to breathe this love she will be loved and finally ending the show with sugar levine grew progressively le clothed throughout the minute show and a he sang the final bar of sugar he wa shirtless with flame crackling all around himwith the super bowl in atlanta the nfl had a surfeit of local musician to choose from for the halftime show outkast ti lil jon future chainz and migos the list go on and onit seems quite telling of something that they chose maroon kevin draperthe first half wa a mess of punt and offensive ineptitude with neither team looking like the powerhouse they had been throughout the playoffsits the lowest firsthalf score since super bowl ix when the steelers led the viking at the halfthe ram defense ha played better than anyone could have predicted holding the patriot to just point and repeatedly stopping promising drive with tenacious pas defense and occasional burst of interior pressure but that still added up to los angeles being down at halftime thanks to a horrendous effort from the ram offense with all six ram drive ending in puntsthe ram offense generated just yard in the first half with jared goff dealing with a great deal of pressure and not being able to get anything going which is at least partially a result of los angeles not being able to establish the run at all behind todd gurley and cj andersontom brady threw for yard in the half repeatedly picking up first down to julian edelman but thus far he ha been almost entirely stymied by the ram defense which ha clearly made a point of delivering hard hit and not being discouraged despite the occasional edelman outburststhe star of the game if anyone qualifies are edelman who ha receiving yard and johnny hekker who ha punted for yardsbill pennington in three postseason game this year bill belichicks patriot have now given up point thats against some pretty decent competition charger chief and ramstom brady throw to rob gronkowski on a thand from the ram yard line led to an unexpected turnover on down ending another promising new england drivebrady had started the drive with an yard pas to julian edelman in which edelman ran over aqib talib to secure the first downafter a short run by rex burkhead edelman picked up another first down this one with a yard catchandrun in which he wa able to get to the edge to secure an extra yard or twothe patriot picked up another first down a few play later thanks to the ram having men on the field but after brady threw incomplete on consecutive pass he found himself with a rdand and his pas to patterson fell just short of converting when marcus peter knocked patterson down just short of the markerthat set up the th down play in which gronkowski could not quite get to brady passbill pennington jared goff is rushing his throw out of sync in the pocket the ram ought to take a page out of the patriot playbook and settle for some shorter throw getting the ball out of goffs hand quicker might yield a couple completion and help with his confidence and sense of timing in the pocketthe ram who averaged point a game this season have had the ball five time and they have punted five timestodd gurley wa finally back on the field which seemed like it could be a morale boost for los angeles and he picked up yard on a pair of rushing play to start the drive on rdand jared goff rolled out after a playaction fake avoided one sack but then wa knocked backward for a yard loss thanks to terrific pressure from kyle van noyjohnny hekker ha already punted for yardsthe ram offense could not answer the patriot score going yard on play giving the ball back to new england with a puntit had briefly looked like the los angeles offense had woken up when jared goff found robert wood on the sideline for an yard gain that may have benefited from a bad call a wood did not clearly get both foot down new england held strong after the play allowing a yard pas knocking cj anderson back for a yard loss and then playing great defense on josh reynolds on a thirddown pas that fell incompletelos angeles ha had absolutely no offensive rhythm in this game

crucial third down reception by julian edelman no surprise there a he turned a rdand into a yard gainnew england struggled after that connection failing to convert a first down even after tom brady found rob gronkowski on a short pas but they had gotten close enough for gostkowski to hit fairly easily making up for his miss earlier in the gamethe team punted on consecutive drive but the ram made a defensive statement on their last stop of the first quarter putting some real pressure on tom brady while also dealing with some long gain from new england receiversthe quarter closed in a scoreless tie with neither team threatening beyond stephen gostkowskis missed field goal attempt but los angeles ha to be encouraged after john franklinmyers produced a stripsack marcus peter very nearly intercepted a pas and aaron donald forced an incompletion a he whipped brady to the ground a play that led to new england first puntthe ram have yet to do anything on offense in this game but they

besotted baseball fan at the age of watching the boston red sox my mother ancestral team march to the world series against the new york mets my parent woke me up near midnight on oct to come downstairs with them and watch the red sox win an eventuality that wa at that moment just a single out away it remained one out away through three single a devastating wild pitch and an incident that shall not be described involving one william joseph buckner i wept slept and awoke a gloomy pessimist forever haunted by the fall of mani became a football fan around the same time and i figured i should root for the patriot a well in new england solidarity they had recently played albeit embarrassingly badly in a super bowl so i wa unaware of their long distinguished legacy of lousy play but by the time i turned and they were working their way through a season with a encore just around the corner i understood a little better the implication of my choicethis combination of red sox tragedy and patriot futility defined my relationship to professional sport until adulthood at which point a you may have heard absolutely everything changed for both team and they became insufferably dominant and my fandom forged in suffering and melodrama and wait till next year rue never quite recovered from my favorite team successeveryone leaf certain childish thing behind of course but there is no greater chasm in the remembered continuity of the self than the gulf separating me from the version of myself whose mind wa at least percent baseball from february until october and percent football for the rest of the year who screamed and raved my way through crucial game and crucial month and who once talked a bos into letting me off work early because of the psychic damage inflicted by aaron boone soxcrushing american league championship serieswinning home run the prior nighti remember that person but i cant remember how he felt and trying to raise my child to be new england sport fan in an age of constant new england winning ha given me real sympathy with the lukewarmly religious the christmasandeaster sort of believer who want to impart some measure of piety to their child without really experiencing the flame of faith themselvesthere are reason besides bostonian sport success for the dying of that flame my current editor probably wouldnt let me out of column writing after a devastating loss and normal adult obligation leave le time for rereading roger angells seasonrecapping baseball essay for the th timebut the frequent triumph of the sox and pat have been crucial to my loss of ardor in the old day i wa always mystified about how yankee fan stirred up the same excitement year after year despite their constant winning and a my team became increasingly yankeelike the mystification remained indeed i missed the thirst enough to seek the feeling elsewhere adopting longsuffering franchise temporarily until the kansa city royal ruined our affair by winning the world series to remind myself of what it wa like to nourish longunrequited hopesdespite that infidelity though ive never taken the step of actually rooting against one of my childhood team which ha kept me connected to both of them however dutifullyand now that the patriot have ground their way in a terribletowatch game highlighted by punt to yet another super bowl victory i want to report a change in my sport psychology in my dutiful connection to the latest run of patriot super bowl appearance i have begun to feel something different strange and unfamiliar not a recovery of the old romance but a growing appreciation of pure ruthless effectiveness an admiration for iron efficiency a joy at the dismantling of highly touted rival a feeling that almost almost make me begin to have a trace of a scintilla of understanding for what it feel like to be a yankee fani say this a someone who feel no particularly personal sympathy or affection for the two men bill belichick and tom brady who have delivered the patriot their extraordinary dynasty belichick is an unpleasant perfectionist whose cultivated public misanthropy and look at me a slob outfit often seem like an irritating sort of performance art brady preferred the supermodel charm of gisele bündchen to bridget moynahan the nice catholic exgirlfriend i saw them at mass together once so im totally in her camp who wa carrying his child and then succumbed via gisele to a proathlete equivalent of the gwyneth paltrowgoop worldviewand without delving into the arcanum of deflategate it obvious that the patriot search for a competitive edge ha taken them to at least the edge of you know cheatingso the old fakepersonal bond that i felt for my flawed new england hero yaz nomah bledsoe isnt there with brady and belichick today what is there and increasingly a their dynasty ha become more improbably extended is something very different a zest for onfield excellence simply for it own sake a forgiveness of personal and even moral deficiency because the record speaks for itself a setting aside of feelgood narrative and romantic underdog story because the sheer force of winning trump them alloh did someone say trump yes it appropriate that the patriot are donald trump favorite team but not because they have too many white player or because their consistent grinding rigorous success somehow resembles his improbable and often ridiculous ascent rather it because the patriot are the actual thing that his grifter instinct and great again sloganeering are constantly trying to evoke a dependably reliably excellent american institution of the kind that people in the previetnam era took for granted and that our own era struggle to reproducethe patriot are to football what the apollo and manhattan project were to militaryindustrialcomplex science what ibm and general motor were to big business what the hoover dam and mount rushmore were to public work with belichick a their pattonmeetseisenhower impresario by turn a jerk and a bore but a winner above all they are a throwback a constant rebuke to the decadence visible in every other american institution their first fan white house very much included a last bloom of the cando genius that won u world war ii sorry getting a little carried away here the point is that unlike my beloved red sox who now win just often enough to make me feel some catholicwithcalvinistancestors guilt over their success the patriot have over the last few year passed into new territory a new sphere of fan experience for the first time since i wa in college and they were scrappy underdog their every victory make me want them to win more to boldly go like neil armstrong and james t kirk where no team ha gone before sorry carried away again the point the point is that i am a changed fan or at least a changing one with every patriot victory i am winning the victory over myself i am shedding old habit jettisoning the underdoggery and romance of my childhood learning to love dynastic rulethe super bowl is over but next season is coming brady isnt retiring belichick is going back to his tape and plot and scheme six super bowl ring

on the player tribune website mr wood called the article a grudgefueled piece of character assassinationjournalistically and ethically he wrote can you sink any lowermr jenkinss other book include limo a novel written with bud shrake an old pal from fort worth who also wrote for sport illustrated it satirizes network television by depicting the creation of a show that prefigures today reality programmingnone of mr jenkinss subsequent novel had the impact of his first this wa partly because the bawdy audacity that characterized semitough seemed le audacious in later book and partly because the character espousing the attitude and employing the language favored by billy clyde and friend struck many reader a much le appealing a public attitude changedmr jenkins openly lamented this societal swivel his character spoke bitterly of it in his later novel and his memoir though full of vintage jenkins phraseturning and storytelling about the good old day of sport and sportswriting is spiked with a sour loathing of what he called political correctness the book echoing the opening of semitough contains some illhumored and offensive remark about asiansas the time book critic dwight garner noted in his review of the memoir his antipc campaign is where his geezer routine cross over into something worsenow this writer is going to be partly remembered for this stuff he added which is a shameits a shame mr garner wrote because of how generous mr jenkins wasi woke up with a smile on my face every morning during the two or three day i spent reading his ownself he wrote the book he

soccer the investigation had produced the dawn arrest of more than a dozen top power broker in the sport and eventually led to the ouster of some of the organization most powerful figure it left others fearful of traveling to the united state for any reason lest they risk being picked up by the authoritiesyet this week almost four year later fifa is bringing the member of it governing council a body that in an earlier incarnation wa accused by the american authority of engaging in graft scheme dating back decade to united state soil for the first time since the scandal broke the member body an expanded group now known a the fifa council will hold a meeting in miami on friday to discus among other thing a significant expansion of the world cup and a multibilliondollar plan for a new world cupstyle competition for clubsthe site of the meeting fifa say is the latest sign that it ha moved on from it corrupt pastits probably fair to say that there is a symbolic significance for the fifa council to meet in the usa for the first time since fifa which is based in zurich said in a statementfour year ago image of police officer leading soccer official out of a luxury swiss hotel in two separate dawn raid gripped the sporting world unleashing a crisis that ha cost fifa million of dollar and led to year of turmoil dozen of soccer official businessmen and company have since pleaded guilty to charge in united state court others are fighting extradition and two men including the former head of south american soccer were jailed after a trial in new york the crisis also led to the ouster of a number of executive not named in the indictment including fifas longtime president at the time joseph s blatterwhile there is little sign another blockbuster raid is in the offing united state authority interest in fifa ha not dimmed multiple defendant who have pleaded guilty in the case have not yet been sentenced with prosecutor again agreeing this year to push back decision about the punishment of at least five people including an argentine businessman who testified at the new york trial and ha served a a key cooperating witnessfifa remains ready to assist public authority in all case and while the experience wa difficult we are finally very grateful that the u department of justice intervened when it did to address some serious governance problem and in so doing help put fifa on the path to reform it statement addedthe current leadership ha attempted to build bridge with the american authority fifas top legal official the deputy secretary general alasdair bell made it a priority to visit brooklyn and meet with prosecutor upon joining the soccer body in september his visit came a month after fifas president gianni infantino met with president trump at the white

canada in the summer of only week after the first raid in switzerland other official also have stayed safely out of reachfifa ha not confirmed whether any council member will skip next week meeting though at least one may not travel according to a person familiar with the council member thinkingcoming to miami also renews focus on concacaf the regional confederation that governs soccer in north and central america and caribbean based in the city concacaf is one of soccer six regional governing body but it perhaps felt the most damage from the scandal three of it former president were charged by united state authority and an internal probe later found multiple example of rogue behavior including selfdealing indiscriminate use of private jet and even the recruitment of a private detective to snoop on individual including the former u soccer president sunil gulati who still sits on the fifa councilconcacaf which nearly closed amid a banking crisis brought on by the justice department case is largely prospering after introducing governance reform it ha also changed headquarters moving from a location in miami beach that wa the target of fbi raid in to a new office in the city business districtits current president victor montagliani of canada said concacaf had long turned the page on it existential crisishaving fifa come to miami for the first time since the event of mark a momentum forward for world football he said and we are glad to play our partwhile it worst day may have passed global soccer continues to be dogged by sporadic episode of unethical behavior by senior figure a ghanaian member of the fifa council kwesi nyantakyi received a lifetime ban last year after being caught on camera accepting thousand of dollar in cash from an undercover reporter and last week another council member lee harmon of the cook island received a threemonth ban for the illegal resale of ticket to last year world cup in russiato miguel maduro a former governance head at fifa the continuing problem are both structural and cultural part of a system that he said wa still being run a a political cartel infantino for example will stand unopposed for reelection later this year in an election that will mirror the one for the presidency of european soccer in february in that race the incumbent aleksander ceferin wa reelected by acclamationperhaps the biggest sign of fifas difficulty in changing the culture is it inability to wean the council member who will be in miami off the kind of lifestyle even they have acknowledged to be excessive at previous meeting for example member have described being met on the airport tarmac and whisked to luxury hotel without having to go through the usual arrival protocol even after fifas reform they receive annual salary of

advertisementsupported bywith issue of race percolating in the nfl several player reflect on martin luther king jr and his protest movementby ken belsonatlanta it is doubtful that the nfl owner understood when they decided early in to play the super bowl here how the city of atlanta a the cradle of the civil right movement would serve a a natural forum for the many complicated social and racial issue that have roiled the league in recent yearsnow many player are showing that the moment is not lost on themon tuesday devin mccourty a team captain on the new england patriot and several of his teammate boarded a bus to pay homage at the martin luther king jr national historical park in the sweet auburn neighborhood of atlantatoday when we have a little time off guy are searching for something to do so theyre not just sitting in a hotel room mccourty said tuesday with this game everything is focused on playing sunday but when you step back and think about it what better way to be on this stage with this platform but also to get a big dose of whats really importantoften the super bowl city is merely a prop for the game and party the patriot who face the los angeles ram on sunday have played for the championship in minneapolis houston and glendale in the past five year but atlanta and what it ha stood for resonates on a deeper level in light of contemporary issue in the leaguemccourty saw that he is one of the leader of the player coalition a nonprofit group that formed to improve social justice and racial equality it wa organized even before the kneeling protest against racism and police brutality initiated by the former san francisco er quarterback colin kaepernick in the seasonthe patriot visit to king birthplace his church and a visitor center wa ad hoc mccourty wanted to go and eventually an invitation wa extended to his teammate ten more signed upplayers in the super bowl rarely get out to see the sight but this group with the issue they champion so embroidered in the dialogue of the nfl said they were determined to make atlanta civil right history part of their experienceany time i come to the south i think of my parent said matthew slater a wide receiver on the patriot whose parent grew up in mississippi before school were integrated this is pretty surreal being here it make you realize there are thing in life that are much bigger than football at the end of the day life is so much bigger than what happens in that game on sundaythis season the clamor over the protest largely faded a only a handful of player kenny still of the miami dolphin among them continued to kneel during the anthem and before the season began the nfl backed off a plan to penalize player who do sostill the debate about the protest and their effect on the league ha not been resolved kaepernick and another player who knelt eric reid have case pending against the nfl accusing it of colluding to keep them off team in retaliationand the choice of gladys knight to sing the national anthem at the super bowl brought the issue back into the spotlight because of comment she had made taking a swipe at kaepernick and other player who did not stand for the anthem it is unfortunate that our national anthem ha been dragged into this debate when the distinctive sens of the national anthem and fighting for justice should each stand alone she said in a statement to news organizationsthe nfl also abruptly canceled a news conference with the halftime act maroon the event are normally controversyfree but several pop star said they would not perform with the band because of the league stance on the protest during the playing of the anthemthe league is also on the defensive because the number of minority head coach fell by half to four after the latest round of firing at the end of the seasonmccourty and his teammate seemed eager to move on from such controversy and focus on the work they are doing to affect changefor a time it wa about the anthem but really it had nothing to do with the issue in our country said mccourty who off the field ha fought for juvenile justice reform with the anthem people would just see is he taking a knee is he in the locker room but for player we didnt care about that we care about doing thing that help student help youth help people in the communityin many way the struggle between trying to effect change through protest and the work of lobbying elected official and working with social advocacy group wa foreshadowed by dr king more than a halfcentury agoin the visitor center across the street from the reflecting pool where king and his wife coretta are interred devin mccourtys twin brother jason a cornerback on the patriot wa watching a video of king effort in to boost the wage of sanitation worker in memphis a the video illustrated king wa assassinated there and his widow ended up holding the peaceful march through the city that her husband had plannedyou start to realize that a important is football is you start to get married family and have kid there are bigger thing that surround u he said though there a ton of work still to do being in this museum and seeing how different time were make you realize there wa some great work done you didnt realize how bad it wasthe player took in the magnitude of the moment after listening to a park ranger talk about the sanctuary in ebenezer baptist church where king wa a copastor the player got out of the pew formed a circle in front of the podium where king gave his sermon held hand closed their eye and prayedlets just let this sink in said jack easterby a coach who helped organize the excursion we will tell our child that standing in front of dr king church that it hasnt always been the way it is nowanother reminder of the tension between protest and change wa on display a few mile away at the high museum of art there an exhibit by glenn kaino a conceptual artist from los angeles brings to life the onearmed salute by the sprinter tommie smith at the olympic game in mexico city in the decision by smith and his teammate john carlos to raise their clenched fist while wearing black glove on the winner podium remains one of the most iconic gesture in sport and beyondthrough print sculpture video and item from smith archive the exhibit entitled with drawn arm show how smith a worldrecord

in the white house with president obama in another smith who life about mile from atlanta hug kaepernicktommie represents a historical moment that ha a greater meaning about what went on around it said michael rook the curator of the exhibit which wa extended for the super bowl the controversy over kaepernicks decision to kneel is in the present and volatile and very much a moving target on where it will go where the nfl will go a a policy what it will mean for fansin a large room with goldplated cast of smith arm suspended from the ceiling and arranged like a foot long parabola enrique beher a cook and jaelyn sims a year old student said they were impressed with smith powerful gesture but also reminded of the debate kaepernick started in the nflpeople think fighting for civil right

featureafter decade of resistance to sport gambling team owner and state official are laying the groundwork for it with potentially huge implicationscreditcreditphoto illustration by najeebah alghadban source photograph sean m haffeygetty imagessupported byby bruce schoenfeldhalf an hour before a preseason hockey game last fall ted leonsis strolled down the concourse of capital one arena in washington stopping every now and then to pose for someone selfie leonsis owns both the washington capital the national hockey league team and the arena itself a squat behemoth that fill a block of chinatown not far from ford theater he also owns other team that play there including the washington wizard in the national basketball association and some smaller one that dontleonsis is easily the most popular sport owner in the nation capital though the wizard have managed just one division title in his eight season and his nhl team underachieved for year it help that the capital finally won the stanley cup last season the city first championship in any major professional league in more than a quartercentury but leonsis is also uncommonly friendly to fan during his customary lap around the arena he fielded question from anyone who came up to him it wa hard to imagine many bigleague owner doing the samea middleaged africanamerican man in a capital jersey approached leonsis what about that gambling thing he asked a few month before the federal statute prohibiting sport gambling wa overturned by the supreme court this wa the first home game since a few state newly liberated to set their own gambling agenda had implemented law allowing sport bet leonsis ha been vocal about his support for legal gambling and he wa full of idea one wa a sport bar he planned to put inside the arena that would handle bet it would fit into a space currently occupied by a brewpub or perhaps displace a fitness center he envisioned betting window like those at a horse tracksports gambling wasnt yet legal in the district of columbia and until it wa there would be no betting window but leonsis is confident that they will come eventually he told me the bar will be somewhere that fan can congregate and watch game and bet on the game in whatever way they want to whether at the window or on handheld device leonsis would outsource the bookmaking because owning a team while taking bet on it game would be perceived a a conflict of interest and probably be illegal instead he would simply offer a site for eating drinking and more gambling except that i want to outlaw the word gambling he said maybe call it interactive wagering when you hear gambling you think of tony soprano im with my bookie people who bet on ncaa pool at their church they dont think theyre gambling they areleonsis who held various executive position at america online from to say he doesnt gamble not on sport or on anything else yet he ha risked both his reputation and his capital on the future of sport wagering he owns a stake in draftkings a daily sport fantasy company that ha segued into online gambling he ha invested in sportradar which delivers at high speed information on game in progress to bookmaking website creating the sort of advantage enjoyed by wall street trader who in his word get a quarter of a second more to say buy that stock he owns part of winview which hold numerous patent for various aspect of ingame gambling he hope to fill the schedule of the nbc sport washington cable channel of which he owns a third with chatter about point spread and gambling opportunity like cnbc he saysgambling on sport became explicitly legal in nevada in until recently the prospect of it spreading beyond that state border wa treated a potentially ruinous by the franchise owner and commissioner who ruled over sport they feared that it would alter the relationship between fan and their favorite team and that gambling would expose athlete to underworld character trying to manipulate game eventually the cautionary tale went the competition in even the biggest league would be indistinguishable from the manufactured plotlines of pro wrestling or oldtime roller derby gambling on sport wa already happening of course at la vega casino on illegal internet site at the corner bar yet somehow that hadnt made it more palatable even five year ago say steve murray a partner with leonsis in the venturecapital firm that ha invested in many of these business you would have had a hard time finding a single owner in any of these league saying that gambling wa a good idea you wouldnt have been able to do itsince then attitude seem to have changed abruptly it now difficult to find anyone inside sport who opposes gambling in part thats because the league and their investor have come to see how much they stand to gain but it also a result of insider like leonsis evangelizing to anyone who would listen in owner meeting in conversation with sponsor even with u congressman during a gambling conference on capitol hill he a visionary and he speaks quite eloquently about what the future opportunity are say gary bettman the nhls commissioner who until recently strongly opposed gambling on sport he ha been at the forefront of pushing u to make sure were a knowledgeable a we can be i get email on this from him daily more than dailyleonsis speaks slowly but exuberantly his conversation unfolds a logically a a business plan what are you so afraid of he like to ask anyone who seems uneasy about gambling were going to create more job were going to generate more tax while pro athlete were once paid poorly enough to make the offer of payoff enticing leonsis argues that a vast majority are today far wealthier than anyone who might tempt them i dont think an nba player is susceptible to some hustler saying shave the point and here in hundreddollar bill he saysleonsis arrived back at his suite shortly after the opening faceoff he sat down in time to see the boston bruin score a goal i mentioned that where sport wager were now legal gambler had surely placed bet both for and against the capital leonsis wanted his team to win naturally even though this preseason game didnt really count but he admitted that just the fact that those bet could be made meant that in a sense hed already wonin the middle of the th century television began reframing the way we experience sport it gave u replay and extended timeouts pushed world series game into prime time scrambled conference affiliation through national telecast and highlight and later superstations and cable network fan grew intimate with team many hundred of mile away now gambling is poised to unleash change just a transformative and they may come fast in an october report pricewaterhousecoopers estimated that a fully developed sport gambling industry in all state would draw billion in bet every year the congressional national gambling impact study commission ha suggested the figure could be closer to billion whatever the size of the jackpot league team and broadcaster will want their piece of it the player the sponsor all the stakeholder in the ecosystem can become beneficiary of this say peter guber an owner of both the golden state warrior and the los angeles dodgersthe game we watch are already enhanced by data collected through technological advance announcer tell u how hard baseball are hit and how far they travel or how many mile a particularly active soccer player ha run because such derivative create new opportunity for betting were sure to see many more of them the nba ha been advertising for a gambling data analyst on the employment website glassdoor hockey hasnt traditionally generated much in the way of metric but in order to learn who is skating the fastest or shooting the hardest the nhl is preparing to record the movement of every player during every game and even put a chip inside the puck league are building a fire hose of data around their product say chris grove an analyst who consults for gaming company and investor and the logical recipient of that data is the betting industrywhat are the chance that someone homer in the next two inning or kick a field goal in the next five minute imagine those odds sliding across the bottom of your screen like the cnn news crawl a a sport medium consultant and former nba executive named ed desser put it how doe the production and presentation of telecast change to accommodate gambling explicit reference to betting might seem jarring during a master broadcast which ha the feel of a conversation in a ritzcarlton lobby but tiger wood and phil mickelsons madefortv showdown in november which included such information gave viewer more reason to care about what happenedrealtime digital wagering ha created betting opportunity that dont rely on the score the appeal of a game in which the patriot are up by point in the fourth quarter is altogether different if you can put money down right then on how many more first down theyll get a viewer create their own narrative tension by betting on piece of the action broadcast right fee will increase and franchise value soar that tension could also be artificially created and exploited by event promoter too if youre the ufc and you have an absolute dog of a fight on a major card for whatever reason you could use odds and promotion around betting to drive fan interest grove point out you could use betting proactivelylegal gambling also open the door to an entirely new source of sponsorship income in english soccer of the team that compete in the sport top echelon wear shirt festooned with the name of bookmaking site dont be surprised to see them soon in the nba or major league soccer game will be held in venue with name like the bet bowl or caesar coliseum and be analyzed by tout on tv and subscription podcasts a you create more interest in these thing people want more information desser say and theyre always looking for an edgeperhaps nobody see more dollar sign on the horizon than legislator it remains uncertain how quickly state will continue to pas new gambling law or how broad or restrictive those will be but few dispute the potential impact i wa talking to some economic development people from alabama say jack evans a district of columbia council member who introduced a sport gambling bill there that is expected to become law in march they were asking how they could raise money i told them put in sport gambling and you can pay off all your debt on the alabamaauburn football game alone one game alabama and auburn youd make billion leonsis ha a stake in nearly all of these possibility he envisions simulcast of every wizard and capital game on nbc sport washington that will include a steady stream of betting information he control two team in the resurrected arena football league and is pitching network a gamblingcentric concept for it game thats too overt for the stodgy nfl at least for now sportradars chief executive told me he expects it billion valuation to quintuple in three year with the opening of the u market which will mean the same for leonsiss stake and if franchise value rise because of fan increased engagement in the sport they follow leonsiss nhl and nba team could be his most profitable gambling play of all in time sport betting may generate it own mark zuckerberg or jeff bezos some forwardthinking entrepreneur who come to define the zeitgeist of his generation for now though the person whose odds are a great a anyones to profit from this emerging industry is leonsis a yearold billionaire who ha been around since the early day of the world wide webthe history of regulated gambling in america go back to when nevada opened the nation first casino the state wa on the verge of bankruptcy a predicament that motivated it to defy the prevailing national sentiment against gambling any state could have done it say anthony cabot who teach gaming law at the university of nevada la vega but no others did just a pro football wa starting to thrive nevada broadened it gambling law to regulate sport bet over the next halfcentury american attitude toward gambling evolved in with great fanfare casino opened in atlantic city a decade later congress passed a law permitting them on land owned by native american tribe by a gallup poll revealed nearly half of all american had played the lottery in the previous month almost a third had visited a casino but just percent had bet on a pro sport event mostly because there were few legal way to do itnobody tried to legalize sport betting outside nevada until chris christie by the time christie became new jersey governor in atlantic city wa in trouble the novelty appeal of it casino had faded hotel booking had plummeted and taxgenerating casino revenue with them christie saw sport betting a a way to counter those loss his first year in office he pushed a referendum that would allow it at any racetrack or casino in the state the referendum passed and christie signed it into lawthere wa only one problem through the professional and amateur sport protection act of which in a somewhat curious twist had been sponsored by new jersey own bill bradley the former nba great turned senator the federal government banned sport gambling throughout the country beyond a few existing manifestation that were allowed to continue those included betting on bicycle racing in new mexico and golf in wyoming several sportsbased lottery horse racing jai alai and the bookmaking inside nevada casinosin new jersey referendum wa challenged in court by the ncaa the major sport league joined the suit a plaintiff but christie had calculated that the supreme court wouldnt uphold a law banning a recreational pursuit in state that had been legal for decade in the th and he wa right the court analyst noted wanted to make a show of limiting federal jurisdiction they just happened to pick a gambling law to do so cabot say last may verdict in what had been renamed murphy v ncaa after christie successor phil murphy surprised the gambling industry youd be amazed how many casino operator didnt see it coming say greg carlin cofounder and chief executive of rush street gaming which owns casino in pennsylvania new york and illinois it didnt surprise leonsis though hed been planning on it for yearsleonsis date his personal revelation about gambling to november when he found himself visiting the remote southwest coast of scotland his daughter who lived in london had a serious boyfriend and both family had flown in to spend thanksgiving weekend at a manor house owned by the boyfriend parent on a clear day leonsis wa told you could see ireland across the water he never could confirm that though because the weather wa never clear the basketball and hockey season were underway back home but the house had no internet or satellite reception so leonsis couldnt follow his team it wa foggy and cold there wa nothing to do he saysthe closest village of any size campbeltown wa minute away one morning they all drove in for lunch nobody seemed to be around the whole town is like two block long leonsis say and there one restaurant and a pharmacy and then we saw one place that had some life to it inside a storefront a crowd wa making noise it wa the betting parlor leonsis learned the phrase didnt carry any connotation of disrepute a it would in america it wa just this is where you go and watch a game and see your friend and hang out he said it wa the cheer of campbeltownfrom scotland leonsis went to london driving through his daughter neighborhood he noticed one betting parlor after another like in america where youd have a starbucks he say he investigated and found that you could bet on sport at outlet in the united kingdom a a comparison he looked up domino pizza and saw that it had roughly store across the united state for me that wa the beginning of hey this is a true consumer phenomenon he say the parlor seemed inviting they werent seedy haunt for professional gambler this is not offtrack betting leonsis say this is starbucks or domino this is popularized and accepted in the most remote place and the most centrally located place if you wanted to find a proxy of what could happen here you just had to look at campbeltown and londonadam silver who is now the nbas commissioner had been doing just that from to silver ran the league video production and programming on frequent business trip abroad he couldnt help noticing how pervasive gambling wa stadium had betting kiosk beside their snack bar there wa this enormous legalized infrastructure in place silver say yet somehow league and team hadnt been corrupted in fact they were thriving silver bos at the time david stern wa a lawyer who had come to the sport during college basketball betting scandal of the s throughout his tenure stern remained opposed to gambling he later changed his mind and for year even refused to hold league meeting and other event in la vega but the opportunity seemed fairly obvious to me silver saysin silver succeeded stern a nba commissioner that year in a new york time oped he made an argument that did not differ much from those advocating the legalization of marijuana despite legal restriction sport betting is widespread he wrote because there are few legal option available those who wish to bet resort to illicit bookmaking operation and shady offshore website why not bring the action into the light he proposed where it could be regulated and the movement of betting line and the sum of money monitoredearlier that fall the nba signed a nineyear billion television right deal at the league board of governor meeting in new york leonsis who wa chairman of it medium committee presented it to the rest of the owner even a he celebrated the deal he cautioned that such fee were unlikely to grow though the cost of operating team inevitably would we have to find new pot of gold he saidleonsis believed he had found them on that trip to the united kingdom you can hold your nose all you want he later told his colleague but gambling offered a viable and wholly untapped source of revenue for the nba leonsis can be almost courtly in negotiation and he wa polite when he met resistance privately though he shook his head how could you ignore such an opportunity ready to be taken advantage of a soon a the law allowed what are you so afraid offor decade sport gambling tended to be a static experience you bet on a team and handed money to somebody and maybe got a slip of paper in return then you waited to find out if you were right that changed when three american option trader moved to antigua in the mids to create an online gambling business they named world sport exchange instead of offering point spread world sport exchange operated like a commodity market before tipoff option on the favored lakers for example might cost each option on the knicks the underdog might sell for at the end of the game the option on the losing team would become worthless while the option on the winning team would each pay out but here wa the novelty you didnt have to wait until the game wa over to cash in if the lakers scored the first eight point the value of that option might grow to say you could sell it and pocket your gain you might then invest in the knicks at a discount or you might wait for the price to fall and buy another option on the lakers you could buy and sell option on either team or both throughout the game once youd started it wa hard to stop until the game ended it wa exhausting it wa also great fun and even more than the other bookmaker operating beyond u border which were handling traditional bet it seemed to threaten the monopoly on sport gambling that nevada casino had long enjoyedi met one of those trader haden ware under a thatched roof in the caribbean in early he wa drinking beer and eating lobster salad steve schillinger a partner at world sport exchange later confided to me that he and ware were each making more than million a year yet they were miserable the interstate wire act of had outlawed taking bet over telephone line in that era of dialup internet access thats exactly what world sport exchange wa doing online gambling wa especially pernicious in the word of jon kyl the u senator from arizona you get up in the morning and log on to your computer and start to gamble it play to the addictive nature of many people especially kid quoting an unnamed harvard professor kyl called it the crack cocaine of gambling a conservative republican kyl introduced specific legislation against internet gambling and vowed to indict expat taking bet online in u citizen were charged with wire act violation among them were ware schillinger and jay cohen another partner weary of living in exile cohen flew home he wa convicted and served month in prison janet reno the u attorney general backed kyls effort so did casino sport league and gambling interest group just about everyone in fact except some indian tribe even the lobbyist being paid by world sport exchange acknowledged that the opponent of digital gambling had a point the casino worked a long time to establish legitimacy he told meeventually world sport exchange wa overtaken by betterfunded rival it ceased operation in that same day schillinger committed suicide after serving his sentence cohen disappeared to europe by then though their insight that betting doesnt have to stop when play begin had revolutionized the industry what draftkings and it competitor are currently doing in new jersey and what company like betfair and bet do in england could not exist without itsince the demise of world sport exchange sport betting on various handheld device ha proliferated and because smartphones and tablet routinely capture the detail of each transaction proponent argue that game are actually better protected against manipulation when digital betting is legal if there wa a huge bet placed against a team two hour before an announcement that it star player wouldnt be participating that is something that should cause u to investigate silver say and it something that historically we wouldnt have knownfor many nba owner and some in other league a well the conversion began in with silver oped and his argument that legalization actually offered more protection not le from the unsavory character who might try to influence player europe wa proving to be a test case and it team were thriving now leonsis ha come along telling owner that their franchise would gain in value because gambling like fantasy league give fan another reason to be engrossed in a sportted wa able to articulate the value proposition of not just the betting but the deepening of the engagement guber say rather than customer leonsis think of fan a an audience he understood that audience want experience guber say this give them a chance to walk away telling their own story i saw this opportunity i recognized what this player would be able to accomplish when you have a tool that make an audience more of a participant than a passenger it a very vital and vibrant elementthere are risk inherent in legalizing sport gambling guber belief but after talking with leonsis he became convinced that it opportunity far outweighed them the nba wa still a plaintiff when the supreme court heard the gambling case in late but by then guber wa among the many owner who were rooting for new jersey to winone afternoon last october terry link drove from his home outside chicago to springfield the illinois state capital an informational presentation about gambling wa scheduled in the house of representative the following day and link a democrat who serf a assistant majority leader in the illinois senate wanted to attend since he wa first elected in he ha sponsored several gambling bill not one became law im still waiting to get one signed he say ruefullybefore dinner that evening he stopped into a bar to meet jeremy kudon a lobbyist whom draftkings and it competitor fanduel have hired to help persuade legislator to pas law allowing digital gambling after ordering a soda link told kudon that illinois casino hoped to use sport betting to get new customer into their building he reminded kudon that casino have generated plenty of tax money for the state because of that link said he wouldnt favor a bill that would allow gambler to undermine them by placing bet from the couch in their living roomsthis wa a problem for kudon because bet placed from livingroom couch are exactly what his client need to survive kudon argued that gambler were already betting from their couch but doing so on illegal website and the state wa missing out on it cutdraftkings and fanduel whose valuation are both estimated to exceed billion were founded on the same idea curate a limitless number of fantasy league for profit generated by participation fee and let customer choose new player every day for many fan watching game quickly became the equivalent of monitoring their investment portfolio except the investment were bet on individual player eric schneiderman new york attorney general at the time thought that sounded a lot like gamblinggames of skill are legal in every state you can pay to participate in fishing or bowling competition for example and win cash prize what you cant do is bet on who you think will win those competition the fantasy site argued somewhat tenuously that constructing a winning team is more like fishing than knowing who is good at fishing schneiderman disagreed in he shut down both site and fined the company at that point draftkings and fanduel began working to get bill passed in state legislature that would certify fantasy sport a legalsoon after leonsis bought part of draftkings he tends to characterize troubled company in one of two way a either falling angel which eventually rise again or a falling knife which dont in draftkings he saw a falling angel he anticipated that digital sport betting would become legal and he agreed with jason robin the draftkings chief executive that the gamingindustry giant everyone assumed would dominate the u market the english bookmaker william hill or maybe ballys or caesar were actually at a disadvantage we have a big database of customer that we know from research are already betting on sport mostly with blackmarket website robin say and we have a brand that is much more identified with winning money and betting on sport than any of them that were competing withlast summer draftkings partnered with a casino a new jersey law requires and became the first company to begin taking digital bet since then it ha done more online business than any other bookmaker it ad blanket cable network in new jersey get ready for thousand of way to bet they shout and theyre not exaggerating one draftkings executive estimate that the company app average to different proposition for gambler to consider every daybut sport gambling law enacted in most other state have restricted digital activity mississippi allows it but only if the gambler are physically inside a casino delaware law ha not yet allowed any digital betting at all some casino plan to leverage their brand online but many regard digital gambling a a threat we have hundred of million of dollar invested in our casino say dan kehl the chief executive of elite casino resort whose family ha been in the gambling business in iowa since kehl back a bill that would require anyone who want to bet on sport to first register at one of iowa casino that wouldnt work in larger state he acknowledges but no one in iowa is more than an hour drive from a casino registered gambler could bet digitally though on only a limited selection of proposition the question is how far can we let the mobile go kehl say that trouble leonsis not just because draftkings might not get the right to operate profitably there but because nobody will if gambler betting on illegal site cant be persuaded to bet legally much of the windfall that investor and politician like terry link are anticipating wont materialize it not enough that state pas law legalizing sport betting leonsis explains they have to pas the right law the only way that gambling doesnt work he say is if the revenue projection are off if it turn out that all those estimate we hear are wildly inaccuratedespite kudons best effort law that leonsis considers favorable have been a difficult sell mostly because of political pressure from casino in springfield that evening link acknowledged that he personally favored digital site partnering with casino and paying them fee but he told kudon the illinois casino insist that whatever fee theyd get wouldnt make up for the loss of all those potential roulette player at that kudon rolled his eye the gambler that were talking about arent going to casino he said theyll never set foot in river a casino in de plaines ill because they can bet on sport on these illegal site so let encourage them to go on draftkings or fanduel instead and river will get a benefit to kudon the mathematics are clear the state get it licensing fee and now weve gotten rid of the black market he said that seems like a win to everyoneif link bill allowed handheld gambling a kudon fantasized traveler might even make bet while changing plane at ohare airport he urged link to consider what that would mean for illinois the million of tax dollar that might be generated if gambler didnt have to travel to a casino to bet link stroked his chin i dont think there a right answer yet link said you have to look at all the factor involved in new jersey nobody want to go to the boardwalk anymore all the casino there are going kaputhe sighed common ground seemed a long way away listen there no such thing a a perfect bill he said the reason we dont pas these bill come down to one word greed nobody want part of the pie they want the whole damn pielast july silver announced that the nba had in a sponsorship deal granted mgm resort the right to use league logo and data even the nhls bettman ha come to term with gambling weve had a very practical approach he told me in his office a few month later the previous afternoon the nhl announced it own deal with mgm though the payment involved wa said to be far smaller than the nbasbut gambling greatest impact at least proportionally could come in the new professional league it spawn and the moribund one it help to resurrect the arena football league once included team spread across the continent last year there were four leonsis owns the washington and baltimore franchise which make him not only the most powerful owner in the league but the only person preventing it demise he ha positioned it a an ideal entertainment vehicle for the next generation that includes gambling of course arena football average a touchdown every six play leonsis note a well a point a game lot of data generated he say and a multitude of possible betsgreater than billion ha been bet legally on football since according to the center for gaming research

mandate a network partner that will market the game a the antinfl informal expressive and gamblingfriendly it doesnt matter that the league a currently constituted ha almost no history he say your favorite team will be the one you have money on at the momenton a private flight to new york last fall leonsis ran through a pitch he planned to show sean mcmanus who run the sport department at cbs he envisioned fastpaced telecast of afl game on an affiliated sport channel but a the plane landed in teterboro nj he confided that he doesnt believe cbs will end up investing it executive are leery of jeopardizing their relationship with the nfl he said and thats probably wise the nfl most likely wouldnt look kindly on one of it primary partner televising another football league game a usual though leonsis wa looking further aheadif the nfl is smart they should want cbs to do this he said see how far they can take it let the afl be the canary in the coal mine see what work and what doesnt work and then they can pull back from there on their own telecast he paused cbs is going to be very nice to u today but i dont know if theyre ready for this were going to blow their mindsan hour later he wa still stuck in new jersey traffic he also hadnt stopped talking about gambling but while his idea had the potential to be wildly lucrative i wa struck by how little had actually happened in the month since the supreme court ruling the betting parlor in his arena remained theoretical draftkings wa thriving in new jersey but it hadnt yet been licensed in another state sportradars explosive growth still existed only in the imagination of it chief executive and most of the gambling law being considered in state legislature included severe limitation on digital play a a result in most state that have passed gambling law early revenue havent met projection the growth process is slow leonsis admitted and unpredictable yet he remained optimistic at aol it took u year to get to million user he said then it took u five year to get to millionjust then his car passed a billboard for a casino that read fire your bookie leonsis pulled out his phone look he said ill show you the draftkings app wa pulsing with offer there were odds on who would win that night nfl game and by how much but also bet on total point on various game odds on tennis match even european basketball i wa scrolling through them when we entered the holland tunnel and everything vanished we just passed into new york leonsis said so now it wont worka moment before id been a legal gambler now if i tried to place a bet from the same seat in the same car id be breaking the law i didnt say anything but leonsis must have read the incredulity in my expression he shruggedits a work in progress he saidbruce

that omitting them from the college football playoff in lieu of oklahoma slow out of the starting block against alabama and notre dame glued to the block against clemson wa an oversightas for meyer himself he departs with a somewhat complicated legacy with great achievement on the field tarnished to a degree by thing that occurred away from ithe won three national title one with ohio state and two with the university of florida and his winning percentage of is unmatched among active coach yet the school suspended him three game this season concluding he mishandled the issue of an assistant coach accused of domestic abuse and at his previous stop in florida there were a considerable number of player involved in offfield misconductso while there is no denying his genius a a coach to his critic at least the report that he would start his retirement by helping instruct a business class at ohio state on leadership and character seemed like satire in fact he will be doing just thatmeanwhile against washington on tuesday meyers buckeye corrected this season main deficiency yielding long gain on the ground coming into the game ohio state had allowed six rushing touchdown of more than yard the most by any football bowl subdivision defense since the husky however scrounged out just yard per carry with their lengthiest running play covering yard they resorted to a tailback pas by myles gaskin in the fourth quarter to finally put a touchdown on the scoreboardwashingtons quarterback jake browning helped generate two additional scoring drive in the fourth quarter both on gaskin rush the latter with just second left in the game but a failed point conversion and an onside kick attempt easily recovered by ohio state closed out the comeback attempt and sent meyer into retirement with a meaningful victorypressed to reveal his thought in the last minute meyer said it wa are you kidding me until we got the onside kicklast week meyer labeled his quarterback dwayne haskins two previous game touchdown pass yard a among the best performance in college football historyyet on the buckeye first scoring drive on tuesday all but three of the initial yard came on run mainly by mike weber who carried the ball four time for yard on the drivewith the husky anticipating another run haskins then hit a wideopen parris campbell for a yard touchdown providing an early validation for ohio state having named ryan day the team offensive coordinator a meyers successorwashington untangled itself from a dreadful start offensively two threeandouts and drove to a field goal only to concede another lengthy march by ohio state that ended in a touchdown on haskins yard toss to johnnie dixonthe husky offense wa so quiet in the first half that browning shining occasion wa a punt out of a shotgun formation that wa downed at ohio state yard linestill another threeandout by washington on it next series enabled the buckeye to flip the field for haskins third scoring strike they needed to motor only yard with haskins finishing the drive with a yard touchdown pas to rashod berrythe scoreboard said at halftime the feeling in the stadium said the gap wa wider and the perception remained so when washington went backward on consecutive snap from ohio state yard line after accepting the secondhalf kickoffseven play later the buckeye seemingly put to bed any doubt that meyer would not exit on a high note reversing the script of the first score haskins threw for all but two of the yard the buckeye traveled and then handed off to jk dobbin for a yard touchdown runmeyers prior departure from coaching wa caused by excessive stress though reduced it ha not been eradicated asked recently if he feel nervous before game meyer said deathly ill might be more

be diagnosed with certainty only in the dead but he and kirstyn now intensely studied the research they saw a clear picture of hairston in all the data point and account of deteriorating brain especially in football playerssecond hairston defied the image of a diminished victim of cte he wa in nearperfect physical health with percent body fat and modelhandsome look confident and charismatic

condition ha centered on brain injury in the militaryscientists are on the verge of being able to confidently diagnose cte in the living it promise to be a gamechanger leading to all sort of complex

make the super bowlby benjamin hoffmanatlanta marcus peter came into this week well aware of the narrative that had developed around himself and the other defensive starter the los angeles ram had acquired since last seasonwhat youre trying to say is how doe he take a bunch of guy who have bad rep and make them act cool together he replied when asked how coach sean mcvay and his assistant handled the acquisition of aqib talib ndamukong suh dante fowler and petersthey all have run into trouble on or off the field so peter on guard for any intent to trash the reputation of the ram newcomer considered the question before continuing i got a coach who just turned he doe an excellent job with u he said i think that u a a team weve been doing a hell of a job by respecting each other and it been all together with we not methat spirit of camaraderie is evident up and down the roster heading into super bowl liii against the new england patriot on sunday the entire team talk about the value of liking one another the comfort they have with the coaching staff they frequently praise the work of general manager le snead who drastically reworked the defense in a series of move last offseason and one significant trade during the season that helped turn the ram from last season breakout team to this season nfc championsnead faced equal dos of praise and criticism a he pieced together a defense that he hoped could better complement a worldbeating offense talib and fowler have been involved in offfield misconduct case suh had long been saddled with a reputation a a dirty player peter a yearold bigplay cornerback had been dismissed from his team in college and made available by the kansa city chief for a trade because of personality conflict and some heated argument with coachesat the time of the trade last february peter made a point of mentioning that all of his issue in the past had been related to intensity on the field and that his offfield record wa unblemishedkevin demoff the ram executive vice president for football operation said his team wa not given enough credit for due diligence before trading for peter and the others we did a ton of research on each of these guy individually demoff said it wasnt like we opened up nflcoms top nfl free agent and said yes yes yes nodemoff said an important element of the decision wa trusting the culture created by mcvay and his defensive coordinator wade phillipsi think we thought that not only could our coaching staff and the organization handle it demoff said but that it wa probably a lot le of a risk than people made it out to bephillips who had coached talib to a super bowl title with the denver bronco said his approach when trying to bring together player of various personality wa fairly straightforwardyou ask them to do what you want them to do you let them know clearly how you want it done and if theyre not doing it you tell them he said a long a youre truthful with these guy they can trust youtalib said that phillips wa a master of letting player be themselves but added that it wa not hard to come together because snead and the team other executive had done such a good job at finding player that would fit togetherkudos to le he said le went out and got the perfect group of guy that could get in the locker room and mesh togetherin the regular season the result were mixed for the ram attempt at building a championshipcaliber defense the unit ranked th in yard allowed and th in average point allowed per game los angeles had ranked th and th in those category last season it biggest success were the interior pressure created by aaron donald who is expected to repeat a the nfls defensive player of the year and turnover which ranked third in the nflthe problem consisted of a propensity to allow big play a softness in their run defense and an injury that cost talib an year veteran eight game and left the team too shorthanded to compete peter showed flash of brilliance but in eight game without talib the ram allowed an average of point a game in the game including the playoff that talib started that number wa in the postseason the whole group ha seemingly been at it best suh and fowler appear rejuvenated generating a combined three sack and talib and peter took the best shot dak prescott of the dallas cowboy and drew brees of the new orleans saint had to offer and walked away victorious both time even after you account for the missed passinterference call on nickell robeycoleman that ha continued to be an issue for the leaguepeters who wa called out by saint coach sean payton for ineffective play in the ram loss to new orleans in week approached payton after the conference championship presumably to remind him of those unkind word proving peter point about how narrative can be twisted some news medium described the encounter a peter trying to fight payton despite video showing that the cornerback wa just talkingnow that he is with the ram peter ha found a team willing to look beyond a headline and find out whats really going on and if los angeles can come away with a win on sunday peter doubted by so many will undoubtedly have

hakeem alaraibimr alaraibi fled bahrain in melbourne australia i will never forget the love and support i wa greeted with the moment i arrived here on feb after spending day in detention in thailand the combined international engagement on my case is what gave me my freedom back i am home now with my wife and for that we deeply thank all who played a role in my safe returnwhat kept me going during these dark day knowing that the whole world wa witnessing the injustice million of people saw me barefoot and shackled at a hearing in bangkok not because i had committed any crime i had not but because i believe thailand ruling family happened to be tightening it relation with the khalifas the family that rule bahrain where i wa born and which i had represented on it national soccer team the shackle were humiliating i am not a criminal though i had been tried in absentia on what are widely accepted to be madeup charge including the nonsensical accusation that i participated in burning a police station at a time i wa playing soccer in a televised match and wa sentenced to year in prison i strongly believe my only crime wa upsetting the bahraini royal family by drawing attention to the failure of sheikh salman bin ibrahim alkhalifa the president of the asian football confederation to protect athlete and his alleged involvement in their arrest and torture after prodemocracy demonstration in the country in i escaped bahrain in after learning of the charge against me and took up residence in australia where i wa granted refugee status in feeling safer i often forgot there were still unfair charge against me and my wife and i planned our honeymooni arrived in thailand only to find myself rapidly separated from my wife and confined to a detention center many people believe that my return to australia wa a glorious victory but to me it is only a half victory i am safe and reunited with my wife but i am also reminded that my dream of eventually going back to bahrain will not be a reality any time soonbahrain ha only a jail cell to offer me while australia is now my home and it government and people have stood by mewhile in prison i had a long time to consider how i got there i have no doubt my imprisonment in thailand wa a punishment for my criticism of sheikh salman a member of the bahraini royal family during his campaign to be elected president of fifa the international soccer organization my highlighting of his alleged violation of human right in likely contributed to his failure to win the electioni am a free man now but what about the more than bahraini athlete and sport official who were arrested and in some case tortured in some remain in prison to this day no credible investigation into these abuse were carried outthere is a dark side to sport in bahrain the kingdom us wealth and sport to whitewash it legacy of abuse and silence those who try to draw attention to this patternthe activist najah ahmed yousif wa tortured sexually abused and imprisoned in for daring to criticize the bahrain grand prix auto race and the journalist ahmed ismail hassan wa shot and killed while attempting to cover protest surrounding the race in salah abbas habib musa a protest leader wa shot by the police during the weekend of the race and nobody wa held accountable for his death next month formula one racing is scheduled in bahrain if the formula one management fails to secure the release of msyousif it should cancel the race in bahrain there are consequence for speaking up but i am willing to take a personal risk and stand up for human right no matter what a are many brave bahraini dont be mistaken a i wa when i went on my honeymoon to thailand i may be free now but i and many other peaceful critic remain a target for bahrain relative of my friend sayed ahmed are imprisoned in bahrain for his speaking out against the regime from his home in london this week bahrain court upheld it threeyear sentence in what the united nation considers an unlawful act of reprisal through family connection bahrain ha been emboldened thanks to president trump who ha made it clear to bahrain that there wont be strain with this administration the united state wa in a powerful position to help end my ordeal but instead it chose to stay silent indeed secretary of state michael pompeo traveled to bahrain and praised the strategic partnership between the two country but made no mention of my case not only did he not mention my situation while i wa still detained in thailand he failed to raise the issue of human right at all the united state had the mean to use it leverage since bahrain is a close ally and host of the fifth fleet but it failed to take a stance britain similarly and shamefully avoided offering support for my situationif bahrain ha learned anything from seeking to extradite me it is that the government can arrest torture and repress it people and country like the united state and britain will continue to look the other way my case underscore bahrain enormous power to flout international standard like lodging an illegitimate red notice with interpol to stop a refugee while he travel it also show bahrain that the united state and britain consider their own interest more important than the life of individual bahraini these country are abandoning human right at a time when thing are worsening in bahrain and will only continue to deterioratei am so fortunate to have been able to return to australia and continue my life but many other bahraini are not a lucky if they received the

his helmet over a sideline benchbehind him coach bill belichick wa yelling in the direction of two assistant who did not bother to turn aroundon the field patriot linebacker donta hightower had a potential interception ricochet off his handsbrady went back out for the patriot next offensive series of the first quarter and swiftly moved them into scoring position but stephen gostkowski missed a field goal the first kick he had missed in five game watching near his team bench brady turned and hurled a wad of white tape to the groundthe patriot were having one of the ugliest performance of any of their nine super bowl in the belichick era and that included the three game they lost yes the los angeles ram were falling apart seemingly trying to give the game away but the patriot had not run away from the confused tentative ram and they were still tied with them in the fourth quarterbut then like so many other time before when it counted most brady and the patriot rediscovered the brilliance that produced five previous super bowl victory an offense once out of sync found a groove that led to a sparkling touchdown driveit wa brief but it had the cool efficacy of an assassin the name so familiar edelman gronkowski sony michel and the patriot defense which wa not even ranked in the top half of the nfl this season somehow kept the league secondranked offense from scoring a touchdownseconds before the final whistle and a last largely ceremonial play the patriot began hugging one another in the huddle second later confetti showered the field and the patriot were winnersthe struggle of the first three quarter were forgotten a puzzling memory but of no consequence any longerit wa tough brady said on the field afterward we just couldnt make the big play we couldnt stay on the field on third down it wa a weird game like that we were doing so much right but none of it mattered until the fourth quarterit wa in many way a microcosm of the patriot season they began the year rallied and then fell apart again but they made the playoff capping their run with their sixth super bowl win tying the pittsburgh steelers for the most they did so by outplaying three of the top team in the league the los angeles charger the kansa city chief and the ram who could never figure out how to solve new england everchanging defensethe patriot left their safety deep for much of the game but kept switching the position of their cornerback keeping them in the ram wide receiver face on one series and then backing off the next and the pressure on ram quarterback jared goff wa relentless for much of the nighta sloppy listless game like sunday might make it hard to immediately declare the patriot championship run this century a one of the best in nfl history but the resilience and the ability to come out on top year after year is hard to argue withit took all kind of way to get this done even week by week brady said we had to grind it out against the charger at kansa city and obviously again tonight when we really struggled to find a rhythmbut i mean world champ again man it pretty unrealthe tone of the game chaotic muddled boring wa evident from the beginning the patriot were having their problem but the ram offense wa hapless they had just two first down in the first halfthe patriot were marching but getting nowherethere wa one patriot having a spectacular game wide receiver julian edelman who had reception for yard and wa named game most valuable player in the first half alone edelman made six catch that resulted in a first down including a yarder that set up a yard gostkowski field goal and a lead that lasted until intermission the ram tied the game with a field goal of their own in the third quarterthe pivotal drive of the game began when the patriot took control of the ball with minute second left in the fourth quarter the first play of the possession wa a nice touch pas from brady who lofted the football over the head of a defender a tight end rob gronkowski circled toward the sideline for yardstwo more brady completion had the crowd at mercedesbenz stadium chanting braydeebrady then settled in the pocket and behind the near flawless pas protection he had throughout the game lofted a perfect spiral that dropped over the head of two fleet ram defender who were nonetheless helplessly chasing the foot pound gronkowskigronkowski wa hobbled for most of this season sometimes comically so and he is openly pondering retirement but after two week to rest various leg and elbow infirmity gronkowski looked rejuvenated his yard catch moved the ball to the ram in the huddle before the play edelman looked at gronkowski and said we need another one from you bro we need a huge playgronkowski said he had been making all the play i had to step upon the next play michel bulled into the end zone for a lead a late gostkowski field goal sealed the outcomethe patriot bungling frustrated and unsure of themselves

advertisementsupported bythe ram and the chief were the darling of the league this season but can they beat the saint and the patriot to get to the super bowlby benjamin hoffmanfor all the excitement created by the nfls offensive firework this season the league could be accused of being predictable from roughly week forward the ram the saint and the chief were considered favorite to get to this point and while it wa a down season for the patriot relatively speaking it will probably be several year after tom brady retirement before people stop assuming he will find a way into the afc championship gameso after all those yard and touchdown it come down to the top four offense battling to reach the super bowl four elite quarterback four team with terrific running game and four head coach who seem more than capable of getting the most out of their playersthere will almost certainly be a great deal of scoring in both game but the result could hinge on a key takeaway or a key pressure from one of the lessheralded defense and whichever team eke out a win will meet in atlanta two week later in super bowl liii here are our prediction for how the conference championship will sort out both in term of who will win and who will win against the spreadlast week record against the spread playoff record against the spread nfc pm foxsomehow the week showdown between los angeles and new orleans did not receive the hype or the praise of the ram thrilling win against kansa city in week but it wa not for a lack of excitement or importance the team combined for point and yard of offense and the saint ended the ram undefeated start to the seasonwhile that result essentially decided homefield advantage for this game and there are certainly aspect of that game that could serve a a preview for this one the ram roster gained two important addition after that day aqib talib and cj andersonfirst and foremost is talib the pro bowl cornerback who wa among the ram most prominent acquisition last offseason he injured his ankle in week had an operation and did not return until week talib immediately took the team secondary from awful to adequateon top of that los angeles ha gotten a boost in the last three game from anderson a running back who never quite reached his potential in denver and spent this season on three team he appears to have found a home a a second running option alongside todd gurley helping spare gurleys balky knee from abuse and providing a different look at the positionthose addition level the playing field considerably but there are plenty of reason the saint were the nfcs top team in the regular season and all of them hold true quarterback drew brees is still firing on all cylinder the team running game is among the best and the most versatile in the entire nfl michael thomas is among the game most talented wide receiver and the new orleans defense doe a terrific job of stopping the runin what should be a fantastic game between evenly matched team the deciding factor could be which overmatched secondary performs better there will be a lot of yardage regardless but if talib can limit thomas the opportunity is there for the ram to come away with a road upset and their first trip to the super bowl since the seasonpick to win ramspick against the spread ram afc pm cbstom brady and the rest of the patriot seem to believe that the football world ha lost faith in them it true that many people picked the charger to win last week though the patriot were officially point favorite in the game but even the most ardent believer in los angeless chance seemed aware that the combination of brady bill belichick and foxborough could easily lead to a win for new england fastforward one week and the patriot are underdog not just in spirit but also in reality against a team that spent most of the season with people assuming it would reach the super bowl the faith in quarterback patrick mahomes came quickly but it wa also warranted a he followed his yard touchdown regular season by easily dispatching the indianapolis colt in his playoff debut last weekendwhen the patriot and chief met in week mahomes had about a much success a a visiting young starter could expect in new england throwing for yard and four touchdown but he also threw a pair of interception and endured the first loss of his professional career of concern to the patriot however is that mahomes seemed to be figuring thing out against them a the game went along kansa city outscored new england in the second half of that game and mahomes tied the score with just over three minute to play by hitting tyreek hill for a yard touchdown only to have brady march his team downfield for a gamewinning yard field goal a time expirednow the chief get a turn to host and arrowhead stadium should be nice and frigid with temperature expected to be in the low s last weekend in the chief win over indianapolis coach andy reid compensated for the snow and cold by focusing on the run and it worked four kansa city player scored rushing touchdown the defense did it part by harassing colt quarterback andrew luck into a poor gamethis time the chief may want to focus on the pas new england is vulnerable there having allowed passing yard this season and touchdown through the air though the damage wa mitigated by a decent number of interception a mahomes ha proved repeatedly he can take chance while still minimizing turnover risk and if he can turn this game into a shootout he ha the advantage thanks to his team superior skill playersthis all add up to kansa city rightly being the favorite with an extremely good shot of playing in the super bowl for the first time since len dawson led the chief to a win over the viking in super bowl iv brady ha every right to feel confident in his chance based on the fact that thing virtually always work out for him and his team chief fan have every right to be worried based on their franchise playoff

england biggest club including manchester city chelsea and arsenal all have invested heavily in their woman team in recent year spending not just on homegrown player but for highprofile import too manchester united even ha finally joined the fray it launched it woman team in the secondtier championship last year and immediately set about recruiting an allstar rosterthe effect ha been seismic not just in term of result manchester city reached the champion league semifinal the last two season and england national team finished third in the woman world cup but in term of interest too more than people attended last season woman fa cup final and two million more watched it live on televisionlittle or none of that growth though ha found it way to doncaster or more accurately rossington a small village on the outskirt of the town where doncaster rover belle play their home game in the third tier of english woman soccercrowds rarely number much more than a hundred here there are no television camera last summer the club biggest sponsor walked away it income now doe not stretch far beyond the cash edmunds sifts through in front of that electric heaterand yet this is the team that ha arguably done more for woman soccer in england than any other a club that wa synonymous with the sport for decade in the s and early s long before the professional club showed any interest in woman soccer the belle were it preeminent forcebetween and the belle reached of woman fa cup final and won the trophy six time the team won the first ever woman national league title in and regained the crown in it would finish a runnersup seven time in the following yearsback then it player formed the backbone of the english national team at one point we had seven or eight player in the squad said gillian coultard who spent year playing for the belle in the team heyday and picked up appearance for england for a long time she wa one of five player to have made a century of appearance for her country the others were bobby moore bobby charlton peter shilton and billy wright it wa a good quiz question she saiddoncaster of course wa proud of the belle a small tightknit town on the edge of the south yorkshire coalfield it is not a place that attracts much national attention or frequently enjoys much sporting success the belle changed that we won so much coultard said the cup final were on television we felt like we represented doncaster and south yorkshire we kept the town at the pinnacleedmunds remembers the club being asked to send representative to have afternoon tea with the queen and prince philip when they visited doncaster the player were guest of honor at the town mansion house the ornate georgian home of the local authority on several occasionswe never had any sexist stuff she said south yorkshire people arent like that it the sort of place where they acknowledge what people can do they get behind you there wa a real pride at what we achievedthere wa broader cultural recognition too the writer pete davy spent a year with the team in the early s his subsequent book i lost my heart to the belle coupled with the club success made the name famous the playwright kay mellor used the book a source material for playing the field a bbc drama that ran for five season in the sto many at a time when woman soccer received scant investment and commanded little attention the belle were the sport most prominent face they were the epitome of woman football said mike blackham like most of the people who go to watch the belle now blackham and his wife jane have a personal connection to the club a friend play for the first teamthat is testament to how the club horizon have retracted in recent year a the fortune of woman soccer have risen those of the belle have ebbed the woman game ha changed edmunds said it is more financially driven we have been left behind a little bitin when the football association the sport governing body in britain expanded the woman super league to two division doncaster belle were demoted to the second tier and manchester city woman team far younger but crucially aligned with a premier league behemoth were promoted in their stead vic akers then the manager of arsenal lady described the decision a morally scandalousdoncaster wa promoted back to the top flight in but lasted only a season before being relegated again it won the second division last year it first trophy since but did not take up it place in the top tier the fa had changed the licensing criterion and the belle lacking a headline sponsor and a major men team to bankroll the club could not meet the new requirement financially we could not do it edmunds saidall but two member of the championshipwinning side departed many for manchester uniteds new woman team neil redfearn the manager left for liverpool the belle decided against using the keepmoat stadium the neat modern venue that is home to doncaster rover the men team with which they have a mostly symbolic alliance and set up instead in rossington where the two stand are little more than a few step covered by a roof smaller surroundings edmunds said would not be a daunting for the young player that now comprised the teamin doncaster the belle fame endures and so doe the affection and esteem in which they are held edmunds for example is wellknown enough in the town that a few year ago when she wa awarded an honor in london for her contribution to sport the local paper afforded her the ultimate accolade it referred to her by only her first nameblackham who coach a local junior team find that while young boy dream of premier league stardom the girl tend to have a different ambition they dont talk about playing for manchester city or chelsea or arsenal he said they want to play for the bellesthere is some regret at the club diminished status the demise of it is very sad because it wa so unique said coultard but there is no resentment of the game authority no lingering anger at the football association for failing to curate the most famous woman team of all that era ha gone edmunds said we do not want people to forget that history because so many people put so much into it but we do not dwell on itinstead she said she take satisfaction in seeing all of the player who came through the club rank who have gone on to play professionally to play in europe to play for their

up zeitler a talented but expensive lineman to acquire vernon wa a significant cost but the brown still seem greatly improvedbell ha a chance to be something truly special for the jet he is a dynamic back unlike any the team ha seen since curtis martin and bell come over on a deal that is nowhere near a rich a what the yearold running back had hoped for when his salary stalemate with pittsburgh began last yearif the team had just added bell and relied on improvement from quarterback sam darnold in his second year the jet could have expected a bump up from last year record but the jet apparently have also traded for kelechi osemele a pro bowl guard and agreed to contract term with the pro bowl linebacker cj mosley and the reliable young receiver jamison crowder who will probably play out of the slot the transaction have been reported by multiple news outlet but not yet announced by the teamthe jet had a long way to go to get back to respectability but their new coach adam gase is about to have a lot more talent on his roster than he did a week ago and after gaining bell in what should still be his prime the jet have an opportunity to be a contender in the near future if they keep buildinglast year the raider repeatedly denied that they were tanking for draft position even a they traded the outstanding khalil mack and amari cooper for draft pick regardless of their motivation in those move they are clearly trying to build now the team fleeced pittsburgh in a deal for antonio brown the star wide receiver in which the raider gave up just two midround pick in move the team ha yet to officially announce they have reportedly invested a great deal of money in the free agent trent brown tyrell williams and lamarcus joynerwhether or not these other move make the raider appreciably better is an open questiontrent brown who just won a super bowl with new england is a mammoth left tackle foot inch pound he reportedly got million in guaranteed money from oakland but other than last season he had been considered mostly a disappointment joyner who wa reportedly guaranteed million blossomed under wade phillipss direction last year with the ram but ha had an uneven career and williams who wa a good vertical threat a the no wide receiver for the charger will need to up his production if he want to serve a a proper complement to brownthe bill did a lot some of the team acquisition are fairly minor running back frank gore in may and entering his th season is inspiring but unlikely to cause a huge impact but it will be worth watching how the addition of the free agent wide receiver john brown and cole beasley affect secondyear quarterback josh allenallen a ha been well documented love to throw deep and brown who wa comically underutilized in baltimore once lamar jackson took over at quarterback is one of the fleetest vertical threat in the game with brown a the no receiver and beasley in the slot all buffalo need is for zay jones or robert foster to develop into a reliable no receiver and allen who creates more disruption with his running than some might assume will be able to truly chuck the ballin terrible news for the writing room of nbcs the good place jacksonville moved on from blake bortles a quarterback who occasionally shined on the team path to the afc championship game two year ago but struggled last season in his place the jaguar added the far more reliable nick foles who went from contemplating retirement during the season to winning a super bowl two year laterfoles whose deal includes more than million in guarantee is hardly a sure thing to live up to his contract he ha had period of dramatic ebb and flow and ha not started more than game in a season at any point in his sevenseason careerof more concern for jacksonville is the loss of both malik jackson and tashaun gipson on defense the team released both veteran for salary cap reason and with foles now on the book it is questionable if the jaguar will be able to afford contract extension for other defensive star like jalen ramsey and yannick ngakoueadvertisement

championship against the same franchise in a similar way for a title that represents not a bookend so much a an ellipsis new england reign is a relentless a a downpour and without precedentthe patriot claimed their sixth title in season by edging the los angeles ram in a slog of a super bowl liiihow the patriot stifled the ram drive by drivelike their previous five super bowl victory under belichick and brady sunday wa not decided until late on sony michels yard touchdown run with seven minute leftone final stop stephon gilmores interception near the goal line with minute second

remembered outside new england a a grind lacking the offensive artistry that defined this recordsetting seasonwe fly you through the scene of two pivotal super bowl playsit wa a if after all the mark

when brady asserts his primacyall of brady other championship have come after the score wa tied or the patriot were trailing in the fourth quarter in those situation brady wa for with yard and three touchdown and no interception taking over at his yard line with left brady connected on four straight pass for yard including a yard beauty to rob gronkowski down the left side that preceded michels touchdown his sixth of the playoffsill tell you this gronkowski said it wa the most satisfying year ive ever been a part of how we came together the obstacle we had to overcome the grind from the beginning of training camp to now it just surrealbrady at age finished of for yard with more than half of that total going to julian edelman a year after missing the patriot super bowl loss to philadelphia with a knee injury and being suspended for the first four game of this season for violating the nfls policy on performanceenhancing drug edelman wa selected a the game most valuable playerhe just played the best game he ha all year brady saidin a league designed for parity brady and belichick have destroyed it together they have made nine super bowl including the last three the miami dolphin from and buffalo bill from accomplished that feat before the patriot but neither had new england staying poweronly one other franchise ha won six super bowl and it took the pittsburgh steelers year to collect their lombardi trophy the patriot needed half a longweve never seen the like of it well never see it again ever the super bowlwinning coach brian billick said last week the league just not structured that waythe patriot infrastructure owned coached and quarterbacked by the same men during this run and ruthless roster manipulation give them a chance every season to extend the dynasty rarely though is that pathway linearbelichicks charge this season a always wa to discern the identity of this team instead of recreating that of another one the patriot quest for selfdiscovery meandered through a pair of twogame losing streak three doubledigit defeat and five road setback until in late december after falling at pittsburgh they found equilibriumcomplementing quick passing with power running new england averaged on the ground across it last five game that approach powered the patriot past two afc west behemoth the charger and the chief and on sunday it helped them gash the ram for yard from michel the lesson a ever the patriot are not vulnerable so much a they are procrastinator evolving before they can pounceback when brady won his first super bowl sean mcvay wa a yearold sophomore at the marist school mile to the north of mercedesbenz stadium he is now at the youngest coach in the nfl hired by the ram two year ago after they finished their first season back in los angeles a a bumbling mess and tasked with shaping a winning team and energizing a fan baseone of mcvays many aphorism seanisms a theyre called is the standard is the standard the ram won consecutive division title but a they gazed across the field sunday they saw the personification of that standard a team whose sustained success they hoped to emulaterams quarterback jared goff grew up watching brady like him a son of northern california while mcvay exchange text message with belichick the mastermind outwitted the prodigy and mcvay knew it blaming his playcalling and an absent feel for the game flowtheres no other way to say it mcvay said i got outcoached tonightmcvay surrounded himself with sharp assistant including the defensive coordinator wade philip who when scheming against a quarterback like brady abides by a singular credoyou cant fool the great quarterback anyway he said you have to outplay themin the afc championship game three year ago when phillips led the bronco defense denver passrush pummeled brady all game brady protection in the playoff had been so good entering the super bowl dropbacks no sack according to pro football focus that he posted to his instagram story a photo of his jersey white and pristine and tagged his offensive linemenearly on the ram coverage and pressure discombobulated new england on his first pas brady wobbly throw

gostkowski scored the game first point on a yarder with left before halftime the patriot lead which signified the fewest firsthalf point scored in a super bowl since pittsburgh led minnesota in did not seem insurmountable but it did increase the likelihood that belichick aided by the defensive playcaller brian flores again had concocted a strategy to foil a prolific offense in the super bowl flores is expected to become the coach of the miami dolphin this weekas belichick did against the bill when he worked for the giant and the falcon who did not score for the final minute of regulation and overtime he silenced the ram like no other team since mcvay took overpatriots linebacker kyle van noy said the defense wa focused on taking goff just out of the gamei think we felt if we stopped the run and put it into his hand it played in our advantage van noy saidin previous game under mcvay the ram had never been held scoreless at halftime on sunday they gained yard their fewest in a first half this season or fewer than edelman who shredded the ram on underneath route los angeles advanced only a far a the new england yard line punting on all six drivesthat meant johnny hekker punted more time than goff completed pass five or the ram recorded first down twoi think youre just numb in a way goff said were trying to process it all but we know what happened we got outplayed we got completely outplayedafter los angeles opened the second half with yes two more punt goff connected on his two best throw to that point a yarder to brandin cook and on thirdand from the new england an yard dart over the middle to robert wood three play later greg zuerlein drilled a yarder that evened the score at the score stayed tied until michels touchdown and los angeles had one last best opportunity to equalize on second down from the patriot just after duron harmon swooped in to break up a deep pas to cook goff looked that way again this time his pas wa underthrown and gilmore draping cook leapt to grab iti knew jared goff wa going to chuck it up gilmore said it wa probably one of the easiest pick ive had all yeargostkowski extended the margin of victory with a yarder with left and after zuerlein missed a yarder a final act of desperation the patriot swarmed the field the scene familiar and new all at oncethey have assembled this unyielding dynasty behind gronkowski and

advertisementsupported bythe texan cowboy raven and bear are all favorite at home but there may be some upset lurking look out for the coltsby benjamin hoffmanit wa a race to the finish for team like the colt the raven and the eagle but there is no time to celebrate a they all now have to back up their nfl playoff position by trying to beat fierce competition the weekend wildcard matchup will be spread over two day with a trip to the divisional round on the lineread tarik cohen make football fun again in chicagohere are our prediction for how the game will sort out both in term of who will win and who will win against the spreadlast week record against the spread final regularseason record pm saturday espn and abcfrom to only three team started the season and made the playoff this season texan not only accomplished that feat but entering week they were also in contention to have the best record in the afcthe turnaround is nothing short of remarkable it is a testament to the quality of the team defense and the star power of it quarterback deshaun watson and no wide receiver deandre hopkins but to join the san diego charger a the only team since to win a playoff game after starting the texan will have to get through indianapolis which had a worse start to overcome the colt were after their terrible start joining the kansa city chief a the only team since to make the playoff after such a poor start and they did it with quality play all over the field finishing with the nfls fifthranked scoring offense and it thranked scoring defenseindianapolis won on the road in houston in week ending the texan ninegame winning streak thanks to an outrageous effort from ty hilton who had receiving yard after that game hilton wa not shy about his ability to succeed at houston nrg stadiumthis is my second home man hilton said with a laugh this is my second home i dont know every time i come here i just go off i dont know what it ishilton wasnt wrong in his seven career trip to houston he ha averaged yard a game and scored seven touchdown while the colt have gone indianapolis also benefit from a fully operational andrew luck who went from three year of battling shoulder woe to attempting a careerhigh pass this season of which went for touchdown the team ha an emerging star at running back in marlon mack and a touchdown machine at tight end in eric ebron and it defense got a breakout year from the rookie linebacker darius leonard who wa snubbed from the pro bowl but managed an nflleading tackle to go with seven sack two interception and two fumble recoveriesthe colt dont typically travel well but houston seems to bring out the best in them they should have the upper hand on saturdaypick to win coltspick against the spread colt pm saturday foxezekiel elliott won his second rushing title this season in just his third year in the nfl despite sitting out week a dominant running back he expects to shoulder the load for the cowboy in the playoff so the rest wa welcomejust knowing that were going into these playoff im going to have the highest workload i probably had all season elliott told reporter since dallas wa in the seven game that elliott carried the ball or more time this season and the seahawks allowed an ugly yard a carry from opposing running back keeping the ball in elliotts hand is probably a good strategy with elliott dak prescott and amari cooper all carrying the offense at different time this season it easy to see why so many people focus on that side of the ball but the cowboy are in the playoff largely because of a defense that ha been retooled into something formidable it allowed the sixthfewest point in the nfl wa the no rushing defense and while the secondary gave up more yard than it would have preferred it became a far more formidable unit with the help of kris richard a defensive back coach who wa one of the architect of seattle legion of boom defenseseattle probably deserved more attention for it play this season than it received largely written off in the preseason a a team that had reached the end of it contention window the seahawks easily qualified for the playoff for the sixth time in seven seasonslinebacker bobby wagner is still among the game best defensive player and russell wilson managed to let the offense become more runfocused while still throwing touchdown pass and a always the seahawks were a true force to be reckoned with at home but this game is in dallas and expecting a team that wa on the road to win there seems unrealistic pick to win cowboyspick against the spread cowboy pm sunday cbswith lamar jackson at quarterback the raven were so dominant running the ball that the total of yard they managed in a week win over the charger wa actually the team low point it is a style of play that would be more typical of the s than today nfl but the raven runfirst approach under jackson led to a finish to the regular season with a series of opponent walking away wondering what just hit them including the charger who lost to baltimore at home keeping score philip river doesnt need a ring to be greatwe couldnt get them off the field on defense charger coach anthony lynn said after the game and we couldnt stay on the field on offense we got outplayed we got outcoached it just that simpleit is hard to figure out what wa more dominant once jackson took over baltimore running game which generated yard in seven game or it run defense which allowed now the charger get a second crack against them and while slowing jackson and gu edward is probably unlikely los angeles can at least hope to generate more than the point it managed at home in week there is some room to pas against the raven patrick mahomes and baker mayfield each threw for more than yard against them in the season second half but the charger should proceed with caution a baltimore generated turnover in it final six gamesthe charger had a terrific season which taken in totality wa more impressive than baltimore but unless they figure something out based on the film of their fairly humiliating loss two week ago quarterback philip river may have his season end early once againpick to win ravenspick against the spread raven pm sunday nbcthe eagle werent even supposed to make the playoff after they fell to and lost quarterback carson wentz to a serious back injury now they enter wildcard weekend on a threegame winning streak hoping they can recreate the success of last season when they entered each playoff game a an underdog and still won the super bowlit is a great story regardless of how it turn out and the backup quarterback nick foles deserves a great deal of credit for revitalizing an offense that had often looked stagnant under wentz this time around the eagle appear to be underdog not just in name but also in term of overall talent compared with the bear chicago rode it suffocating defense and a goodenough offense to the thirdbest record in the nfc and it formula of forcing turnover and running the ball tends to play well once january roll around the eagle might not have to contend with chicago best defensive back eddie jackson who is questionable with an ankle injury but the bear still have plenty of defender who should give foles nightmare including khalil mack akiem hick and kyle fuller chicago offense is not nearly a advanced a it defense mitchell trubisky is a tentative passer but jordan howard and tarik cohen have the ability to grind game out on the ground because the defense score so much on it own the bear finished with the ninthmost point in the nfl despite being ranked st in total yard by no mean should philadelphia be written off in this game a the eagle have a championshipwinning defense in place and an offense
