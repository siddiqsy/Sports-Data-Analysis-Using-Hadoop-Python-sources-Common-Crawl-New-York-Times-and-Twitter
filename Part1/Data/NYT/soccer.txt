soccer in england than there ha ever been last summer the country highest tier the woman super league wsl became for the first time fully professional with a broadcasting arrangement with the bbc england biggest club including manchester city chelsea and arsenal all have invested heavily in their woman team in recent year spending not just on homegrown player but for highprofile import too manchester united even ha finally joined the fray it launched it woman team in the secondtier championship last year and immediately set about recruiting an allstar rosterthe effect ha been seismic not just in term of result manchester city reached the champion league semifinal the last two season and england national team finished third in the woman world cup but in term of interest too more than people attended last season woman fa cup final and two million more watched it live on televisionlittle or none of that growth though ha found it way to doncaster or more accurately rossington a small village on the outskirt of the town where doncaster rover belle play their home game in the third tier of english woman soccercrowds rarely number much more than a hundred here there are no television camera last summer the club biggest sponsor walked away it income now doe not stretch far beyond the cash edmunds sifts through in front of that electric heaterand yet this is the team that ha arguably done more for woman soccer in england than any other a club that wa synonymous with the sport for decade in the s and early s long before the professional club showed any interest in woman soccer the belle were it preeminent forcebetween and the belle reached of woman fa cup final and won the trophy six time the team won the first ever woman national league title in and regained the crown in it would finish a runnersup seven time in the following yearsback then it player formed the backbone of the english national team at one point we had seven or eight player in the squad said gillian coultard who spent year playing for the belle in the team heyday and picked up appearance for england for a long time she wa one of five player to have made a century of appearance for her country the others were bobby moore bobby charlton peter shilton and billy wright it wa a good quiz question she saiddoncaster of course wa proud of the belle a small tightknit town on the edge of the south yorkshire coalfield it is not a place that attracts much national attention or frequently enjoys much sporting success the belle changed that we won so much coultard said the cup final were on television we felt like we represented doncaster and south yorkshire we kept the town at the pinnacleedmunds remembers the club being asked to send representative to have afternoon tea with the queen and prince philip when they visited doncaster the player were guest of honor at the town mansion house the ornate georgian home of the local authority on several occasionswe never had any sexist stuff she said south yorkshire people arent like that it the sort of place where they acknowledge what people can do they get behind you there wa a real pride at what we achievedthere wa broader cultural recognition too the writer pete davy spent a year with the team in the early s his subsequent book i lost my heart to the belle coupled with the club success made the name famous the playwright kay mellor used the book a source material for playing the field a bbc drama that ran for five season in the sto many at a time when woman soccer received scant investment and commanded little attention the belle were the sport most prominent face they were the epitome of woman football said mike blackham like most of the people who go to watch the belle now blackham and his wife jane have a personal connection to the club a friend play for the first teamthat is testament to how the club horizon have retracted in recent year a the fortune of woman soccer have risen those of the belle have ebbed the woman game ha changed edmunds said it is more financially driven we have been left behind a little bitin when the football association the sport governing body in britain expanded the woman super league to two division doncaster belle were demoted to the second tier and manchester city woman team far younger but crucially aligned with a premier league behemoth were promoted in their stead vic akers then the manager of arsenal lady described the decision a morally scandalousdoncaster wa promoted back to the top flight in but lasted only a season before being relegated again it won the second division last year it first trophy since but did not take up it place in the top tier the fa had changed the licensing criterion and the belle lacking a headline sponsor and a major men team to bankroll the club could not meet the new requirement financially we could not do it edmunds saidall but two member of the championshipwinning side departed many for manchester uniteds new woman team neil redfearn the manager left for liverpool the belle decided against using the keepmoat stadium the neat modern venue that is home to doncaster rover the men team with which they have a mostly symbolic alliance and set up instead in rossington where the two stand are little more than a few step covered by a roof smaller surroundings edmunds said would not be a daunting for the young player that now comprised the teamin doncaster the belle fame endures and so doe the affection and esteem in which they are held edmunds for example is wellknown enough in the town that a few year ago when she wa awarded an honor in london for her contribution to sport the local paper afforded her the ultimate accolade it referred to her by only her first nameblackham who coach a local junior team find that while young boy dream of premier league stardom the girl tend to have a different ambition they dont talk about playing for manchester city or chelsea or arsenal he said they want to play for the bellesthere is some regret at the club diminished status the demise of it is very sad because it wa so unique said coultard but there is no resentment of the game authority no lingering anger at the football association for failing to curate the most famous woman team of all that era ha gone edmunds said we do not want people to forget that history because so many people put so much into it but we do not dwell on itinstead she said she take satisfaction in seeing all of the player who came through the club rank who have gone on to play professionally to play in europe to play for their

course familiar the new stadium is on the same patch of land a the atmospheric historic old white hart lane where spur played for year the horizon though is different the club hope the new stadium represents not just a great leap forward for spur proof in concrete and steel that this team belongs among europe preeminent power but for english soccer a a wholechris lee it chief architect said he had looked at some stadium around the world for inspiration and incorporated the best element he could find into what he labeled the best stadium on the planet an arena supposed to be more modern than wembley sleeker than old trafford bigger crucially than arsenal home at the emirate it is supposed to set what daniel levy the spur chairman described a a new standard for sport stadiumsthe arena centerpiece is the biggest singletier stand in england capable of holding fan modeled on borussia dortmund südtribune known more commonly a the yellow wall it claim to be home to the longest bar in europe it ha a retractable field allowing it to host not only premier league match but nfl game too it ha it own microbrewery and a restaurant run by a michelinstarred chef and in what is surely a first for a soccer team spur will have it own onsite sommelierthe appeal for levy and the club of course is the financial boost all of that can bring more fan spending more time and more money all of it flowing straight into the team coffer levy said tuesday that with the extra revenue generated by the stadium spur income would be in the world top this is a team that ha long had to wheel and deal in the transfer market on sunday the club manager mauricio pochettino admitted he and his staff had laughed at the sight of naby keita and fabinho million worth of talent combined on liverpool bench when the team met representing a luxury way beyond spur mean tottenhams new home is in time supposed to change that to turn spur into a club that can compete with the elite not just on the field but off itthe effect of the stadium though will resonate beyond spur balance sheet the club ha long claimed it can be a catalyst for the regeneration of the neighborhood around it at a news medium presentation on tuesday the club executive director donna cullen opened with a photograph of a burning car a reminder of the riot that scarred the area before spreading across the capital and the country in that hot angry summer cullen said wa the trigger for spur to think about what it could do to improve not only it own horizon but those of the place it represents the area around tottenham haringey is the fifthmost deprived borough in london she said the club wa taken over by a spirit of let see what we can dothe local authority haringay council doe not entirely accept the idea that tottenhams rebirth rest on the stadium charles adje the councilor responsible for regeneration said he would not use the word catalyst himself but he acknowledged that it add value to the areaboth the club and the council project that the new stadium could pour around million a year into the local economy spur estimated that it would be responsible for more than job this stadium and this new club is going to make a massive massive difference to the people of tottenham david lammy tottenhams member of parliament said this weekthat too will take time of course so far the main visible difference to tottenham high road are the new facade on the sandwich bar the convenience store and a handful of other property across from the stadium the street running to and from it are otherwise much the same a always a jumble of jerk chicken place and nail bar polish supermarket and tumbledown mechanicssmoking a cigarette outside the barbershop he ha run for year inan gulecyuz said he wa happy to wait the stadium opening is technically bad news for him business drop on game day he said and with soccer and the nfl to fit in he will lose a little tradethat will he hope be offset by the benefit it will bring they have changed a lot of the shop just up the road he said hopefully the same thing will happen down the road tooa little further from the stadium irfan sahin wa serving coffee in fieldseat his delicatessen café bookshop and organic food market soft classical music played overheadsahin said that he expected the stadium to alter the character of the area to encourage more business to open there is no other michelinstarred restaurant in north london he noted but then he said tottenham is changing anyway in london gentrification is a constant tide regardless of where soccer club playit is very different from when i first came here in he said it is slow of course we had two gang fight right outside in the last year or so but there are more place opening all of the time bar and pub and cafés and restaurant it is not a expensive a central london or a expensive a east london so it is a good place to open hopefully it will be better with the stadiumacademic literature is unclear on whether that will hold true writing in the journal of economic perspective in john siegfried and andrew zimbalist concluded based largely on case study in the united state that while team owner have argued that sport facility boost local economic activity economic reasoning and empirical evidence suggest the oppositethere are those in tottenham certainly who feel disenfranchised by the speed of change and by redevelopment proposal backed by the council and the club there is a real risk of company going out of business if we can not find alternative location in the neighborhood said feruk tepeyurt the owner of a local joinery firm and chairman of the peacock industrial estate home to more than small business but under both the council plan and a separate project proposed by the club scheduled to become a park do we need a park or do we need a community of small business a lot of them run by local black and minority ethnic peoplethat is the tension inherent in any regeneration of course the issue of who precisely it is supposed to work for of whose need it is meeting there is a thin dividing line between seeing the stadium a a catalyst for regeneration and a trojan horse for social cleansing said mark panton an academic at birkbeck college who ha written extensively on the disputethere is one change left to come transport for london the capital transit authority is expected to accept a proposal to rename white hart lane the nearest train station to the stadium to tottenham hotspurit is not unprecedented arsenal ha had it own tube stop dating to the s but nor is it universally popular the objection is based on the idea that erasing the station name wipe clean a century or so of history that it needlessly hamfistedly conflates the identity of tottenham the area and tottenham the team that it creates the impression deep down below the fresh coat of paint that the place exists to serve the club rather than the club existing

unflattering light on some of the sport most popular club player and coacheslast week the man behind the leak a yearold portuguese citizen named rui pinto wa arrested in budapest hungary he face extradition to his home country on the charge which include an extortion attempt in on a secretive investment fund that had bet million of dollar in the player transfer marketfor the moment though pinto fate depends on a far narrower matter whether his team of lawyer can successfully argue that he is a whistleblower under hungarian law a defendant whose action to expose malpractice and potentially a raft of financial and other crime in soccer outweigh any offense he might have committedin the view of the portuguese authority pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund doyen sport they and doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company document revealing transfer fee and secret payment unless the fund paid him to keep the document privatethose document which offered a window into both doyen business model and it bank account were later published on the website known a football leak the revelation along with a number of player contract posted on the site exposed a murky world of soccer finance that wa at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulationsultimately pinto turned over about million document and terabyte of information to a german newsmagazine der spiegel which shared document with a select group of news medium outlet who published report on their contentsnow that pinto ha been arrested on a portuguese warrant his case represents a highprofile test of a hungarian law passed in that affords special protection to whistleblower his lawyer plan to argue that the lead his leaked document provided to a variety of european law enforcement organization outweigh pinto actionsbased on the leak there have been some extremely important criminal investigation opened with prosecution in various country said william bourdon pinto lawyer who previously ha represented the nationalsecurity whistleblower edward snowden without pinto this wouldnt have been possiblethose investigation include several tax case in spain where top soccer star including cristiano ronaldo have been prosecuted for tax evasion after football leak revealed detail of the complicated structure through which they received million of dollar in salary and image right pinto lawyer said that he also ha been in contact with french financial crime prosecutor since late more recently football leak disclosure have targeted the fifa president gianni infantino and the way some top club might have circumvented the sport financial regulation the revelation also led to the reopening of a sexual assault case against ronaldounlike in most whistleblower case however pinto ha no official connection with the soccer industry no access to club book or a player contract beyond being a fan of the gamefor me it doesnt make a difference considering what is the basis of whistleblower protection the intensity of the contribution to the public interest bourdon said this is the key pointbourdon said pinto already had agreed to assist the authority in switzerland and that germany tax agency wa seeking access to his information too but it is the decision of a hungarian judge that matter most to him at the moment since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to portugalwe expect the hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation bourdon said that on one hand he being prosecuted in portugal while on the other he ha been providing assistance to prosecutor in other countriesbourdon said that he see little difference between pinto and one of his former client hervé falciani who leaked account detail of client of the british bank hsbc while he worked in geneva falcianis disclosure which shook the secretive world of swiss banking revealed account containing more than billion and led to the bank agreeing to pay million euro about million to french authority to settle a taxevasion investigationspains high court last september rejected an extradition request for falciani once labeled the edward snowden of banking from switzerlandin addition to pinto extradition the portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in hungary bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected extortion attemptbourdon acknowledged that pinto had attempted to make contact with doyen once he had the company document but he said the extortion charge were not valid because pinto ultimately didnt follow through with an operation to secure a paymentbourdon described the charge a a tool to criminalize him to target him a an offender and not a whistleblowerlittle is known about pinto a der spiegel reporter rafael buschman is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with football leak buschman ha written a series of breathless account and a book detailing his relationship with a

decade ha shifted change ha swept through the champion league european soccer landscape ha been transformed not that it wa easy to tell from barcelona last night here where the host thrashed lyon on wednesday it all felt the same a everthis ha been a tumultuous week the peak came right away real madrid the team that had held this competition in it thrall seemingly incapable of not winning it it opponent apparently dazzled by the mythology of those bright white jersey humbled at home by a young and vibrant and entirely dismissed ajaxthe next night paris stgermain fell the prize it qatari backer covet more than any other once again proving elusive despite the cushion provided by a twogoal lead from the first leg and the insurance policy of a squad assembled at extravagant expensethere might ordinarily have been some solace in being eliminated by one of europe true giant manchester united but that would only have applied if it had been manchester uniteds first team it wa not it wa a patchwork scratch sort of a side cobbled together with what little material manager ole gunnar solskjaer had at hand and it wa still enoughand then on tuesday night that other great cornerstone of european soccer atlético madrid defense so miserly and obdurate came unstuck it wa generally held to be inconceivable that a team a disciplined and well organized and gnarled a diego simeones could contrive to throw away a twogoal firstleg lead but contrive to it did it wa not a lack of character simeone said in turin juventus wa just better than u he ha not built his reputation on such

time in year there will be no german team present on friday when the draw for the quarterfinal is made there will be four representative from the premier league for the first time in no wonder then there is a sense that the guard is changing that this will prove to be the season that bridge two distinct age the time of this incarnation of real madrid ha passed most obviously but perhaps that can be said of others among the clutch of superclubs who have for the last decade dominated the latter stage of this competition toobayern is gearing up to rejuvenate it squad atlético will lose the player that ha best encapsulated it recent history the grizzled uruguayan defender diego godín this summeras they stumble the english rise manchester city destruction of schalke cemented it place a the favorite to inherit real madrid crown liverpool reached the final last year and is a more rounded more durable side this time around tottenham beat borussia dortmund in both leg displaying a maturity it ha previously lacked manchester united reborn under solskjaer ha a sense of abandon and fun that make it dangerousthe premier league is at last benefiting not only from it vast financial advantage over the rest of europe but from it decision belated admittedly to spend a rather greater proportion of that on manager rather than playersthat is one reading of the situation anyway it is not the only one the champion league is about team of course and about dynasty and era and power base and all of that but more than anything it is about player indeed if the dominance of real madrid taught u anything it wa that currently at least this is a competition defined by individual more than by system and those individual have not changed at allon tuesday it wa cristiano ronaldo scoring yet another hattrick to pull juventus clear of atlético to send the allianz stadium into rapture to deliver on the reputation that convinced the italian champion to spend somewhere north of million on a yearold forward last summerand on wednesday obviously it wa lionel messi scoring twice creating twice and orchestrating barcelona demolition of a courageous fearless but utterly outgunned lyonfor a while the french visitor discomfited barcelona for a while there wa a gentle draft of change here too if not quite a full wind lyon defended valiantly and counterattacked with zest before barcelona broke the deadlock a messi penalty deftly almost thoughtlessly chipped past anthony lopesfor a few minute in the second half too lyon had hope lucas tousart had made it a single strike a bounce of a ball would have been enough to add barcelona to the list of giant toppled this season it did not last long messi soon snatched it awayhis second goal a delicate shot at the end of one of those mazy dribble where the ball seems to fall completely hopelessly under his spell effectively killed the game before his two assist for gerard piqué and ousmane dembélé helped a victory bleed into a routbut that is not what stood out what make messi so captivating is that it is not just the killer blow that count but all of the jab and the thrust and the parry it is watching him dance around and skip over and ghost away from tackle it is the precision of his passing his unerring ability to make the right choice messi rarely try the spectacular the unlikely he doe not abuse his status his talent he just make sure he doe everything almost everything right his gift ha always been his simplicity that is not fading not at all not yeteras do end and time do change identifying when is not an exact science of course they tend to drift into each other there are rarely clean break but perhaps it is fair to say that real madrid period of dominance is at an end or that the age of the superclubs ha been put on hiatus or even that spain preeminence in european competition every champion league title since and of the last is overbut it is equally possible that none of those era existed in the first place and that instead they were simply consequence of the age of messi and of ronaldo their team the beneficiary of their greatness their ability to decide game and define season that ha not

knew he is not the first in his position to have worn that look to have made that walk to sense that sooner or later chelsea ha a decision to makein these circumstance that ordinarily mean only one thing historically when chelsea is presented with the choice of whether to fire a manager or not it tends to act a if it ha no choice at allroman abramovich ha fired manager early and fired them late he ha fired them after winning the premier league title but not the champion league he ha fired them after winning the champion league but not the premier league he ha fired them against the fan wish and he ha fired them to their intense relief he ha fired them for le than being beaten by manchester city a sarris chelsea wa on sunday and he ha fired them for moreabramovich ha been through permanent manager since he arrived in english soccer in by this stage of this season abramovich or more pertinently those who run chelsea at his behest know the sign not just the obvious one the backtoback collapse away from home first at bournemouth and now in manchester the inexorable slide down the premier league table initially out of the title race and now usurped by a resurgent manchester united out of the champion league qualifying placesthere are the subtle one too not once but twice since the turn of the year sarri ha criticized his player publicly questioning both their mentality and their motivation after a defeat to arsenal last month he took the unusual step of making his public comment through a translator just in case he could not find quite the right phraseology a he laid bare his complaint about his squadit is a risky strategy one with the air of a final throw of the dice it is telling then that there ha been no visible uplift in performance since sarris public intervention if anything thing are getting worse chelsea ha still not scored a premier league goal away from home in sarris team wa if anything somewhat fortunate only to concede six on sundaythat too doe not bode well when he arrived from napoli belatedly after a long legal tussle between chelsea and his predecessor antonio conte that is still not resolved sarri warned that his method were sufficiently bespoke that the player might need some time to adapt to them there would be he admitted teething troublescuriously they were not immediate chelsea hit the ground running eden hazard declared himself delighted to be playing at last for a manager who prioritized attacking soccer who might let him have the fun he seeksthe problem came later sarris prediction coming good on a satellite delay and the season slowing to a halt a winter set in it is a if chelseas player have unlearned what sarri taught them a if they tried his way for a while and then decided actually no this wasnt right for themthis is familiar ground at chelsea the manager and the player drifting apart the word no longer seeming to carry weight the instruction and idea not quite cutting through the same thing happened to josé mourinho in and then to conte last year everybody know how the story end it is not with the player moving onsarri judging by his demeanor at the final whistle sunday recognizes that this is the sort of result he will know that brings with it immediate jeopardy that provides compelling evidence to support his dismissal there is though an equally convincing case to be made for precisely the opposite an argument that might make chelsea pause even a it begin to prepare the severance checkit run like this manchester city ha what chelsea ha always craved not just success but sustained success consistent success an unwavering direction more than that it ha a distinctive immediately apparent style an enviable character and identity a devastating beautyit is not that chelsea ha not been successful of course abramovich ha brought five premier league title to stamford bridge one champion league crown and more fa cup than anybody would want too chelsea still outstrips city the two great transformative club of modern english soccer in term of honor wonbut chelseas ha been a boomandbust kind of success bountiful year followed invariably by fallow one one that is the result not so much of a carefully crafted plan but of the harnessing of chaos it ha long seemed fragile somehowcitys is different city ha had a little chaos in it time too of course the firing of mark hughes and roberto mancini the existence of carlos tevez and mario balotelli and it prominence wa hardwon just a little slower than many might have expected given the rich injected into the club by it emirati benefactorsbut now a little more than a decade since their arrival the path is set city may not win the premier league title this year this victory showed just how well liverpool and tottenham have done to keep pace with pep guardiolas team for this long but it will at least come close it will be the favorite to lift the trophy again next year and the year after that it is hard to imagine city slipping to sixth in the near futurethat is a consequence of the amount of money spent on the club but it is also testament to the way that money ha been spent building a team that is capable of playing the sort of soccer guardiola preaches that rival player and fan look on with envy that take the breath awaythat is what abramovich ha always wanted for chelsea it is why he pursued guardiola for so long why he appointed andré villasboas in supposedly cut from the same cloth and why he brought in sarri last summerit is not just a latent aestheticism it is also an economic argument the sort of identity that city ha brings result not always not every year but over the long term it help lure new signing and it pinpoint who precisely those player should be it stave off the need to fire manager every year or so to rip up the blueprint to start again by scouring the transfer market for new player or asking old one to learn new trick a defined identity stave off the turmoil of a poor run of form of a disappointing season the difference between a detour and a road to nowhere it mean there can be certainty where otherwise there may be doubtthe problem of course is that it take time even guardiola a it turned out needed a year to shape city into what he wanted it to be and that wa with a team that had been built with him in mind long before he joined it requires patience and understanding it can not be conjured over a summer or over a season it doe not materialize if you keep firing your managerthat then is the choice that chelsea face fire sarri and the boomandbust cycle will be prolonged and perhaps that would be the right decision perhaps he is too inflexible to succeed in england perhaps what he achieved at napoli can not be repeated perhaps his tactic have been worked out by opponent and he ha nothing more up his sleeveat some point though chelsea will have to do the opposite it will have to stick with someone to accept that time is just a important a money to go through a fallow year in the hope that bounty follows it want what city ha to get it it must start to do what city doesfollow rory smith on twitter

advertisementsupported byon soccerby rory smithmanchester england at last it seems among all of the hundred of million of pound that float around the premier league the penny ha droppedthe january transfer window ha come and gone barely noticed there ha been no orgy of excess no frantic scramble to spend a much money a possible no broken transferspending record no helicopter dash no latenight dramafor once for the first time perhaps english soccer ha been a model of restraint and of prudence for once it ha looked not at price but at worth a one executive at a premier league team told the time of london people are asking crazy money for average playersthat of course should hardly have come a a shock the club in the cashsoaked premier league with it lucrative broadcasting deal and it seemingly bottomless pit of wealth had no sooner helped to create soccer superheated transfer market than they began to suffer from itin england manager and technical director and chief executive whisper darkly of an english tax claiming that their counterpart on continental europe routinely quote them higher price than they would a team from germany italy or spainin public those working in sale or recruitment in europe dismiss that allegation two sporting director told the time in that they work with one price in mind for a player regardless of origin or destination but there can be little doubt that at the very least many see english team a easy marksin part that is to their credit according to one executive at a bundesliga team selling to a premier league club is a much more straightforward business than offloading a player to italy or spain the money is invariably paid upfront one lump sum deposited into your account upon completion of the deal rather than an installment plan contingent on a host of clause it is also rather more palatable to fan club in germany he said have broadly welcomed english interest in their best player simply because the alternative is seeing them move with dread predictability to bayern munichthat is not however the limit of it appeal the evidence is anecdotal but nonetheless compelling europe club see the premier league a a cash cow and it member club a rather deeper of pocket than they are of thoughtthere are for example executive who tell story of hanging up the phone to a continental team and then immediately doubling the asking price when an english club call there are sporting director who recall scarcely being able to conceal their glee when a premier league team asks to buy one of their player or the celebration when they complete a deal for a vastly inflated priceand there is the manager who wa presented with a tall south american forward by his club owner a few year ago and told that it did not matter if the deal worked out because even if he did not score goal an english team will come and buy him for more than we paid anywaythere will be plenty then who will see the dripfeed of smallbeer deal and loanswithanoptiontobuy that have populated this january transfer window and believe that it is just an exception something cyclical that come summer the premier league will be showering it largess on europe once moreit is worth noting though that yearonyear spending last summer wa down too barely noticeable in the raw figure billion billion a opposed to billion in but in the context of a global market that had been distorted beyond recognition by the fee paris stgermain paid for neymar an eyecatching dropas unlikely a it sound the possibility ha to be considered that the premier league ha finally managed to shake it reflex reaction to spend it way out of any problem to break free of it shopaholism to overcome it addiction to the shortterm high of a lavish transferit would be reductive to attribute that to one cause it is the result in all likelihood of a confluence of factor few in soccer for example believe that the uncertainty that ha infected most british industry because of brexit ha had much of an effect but it is hard to believe the weakness of the pound against the euro ha not given at least some club pausethen there is the assumption in the premier league that english soccer television boom might have plateaued and that the next broadcast deal will not deliver the exponential rise in income to which the club have grown accustomed that too may have persuaded club to become just a little more frugalif certain club have chosen not to spend liverpool and manchester city for fear of disrupting the delicate harmony they have established manchester united because a permanent manager and a technical director must be appointed first others have been unable to do soin the case of tottenham with a new stadium to consider and chelsea subject to a fifa investigation over rule breach related to young player those circumstance are bespoke for others the issue is much broader the shortterm costcontrol measure established by the league club effectively link increase in a team wage bill to growth of it commercial revenue that arsenal for example ha not increased the latter mean it is not in a position to throw money at the formernone of that though explains why everyone ha been so parsimonious so uncharacteristically cautious yet the trend is widespread enough to suggest that there ha been a more fundamental change that english team no longer suspect they are being taken for a ride but know they are and are determined to put a stop to itengland for many year stood a a last defiant bulwark against the idea that recruitment should be overseen not by a club manager but by a technical or sporting director such an appointment it wa thought would only undermine the authority of the man tasked with picking the team in a country that sanctified the memory of matt busby and alex ferguson and brian clough the manager position wa inviolablethat is no longer the case of the elite only manchester united doe not have a technical director and it is in the process of finding one away from old trafford most team have moved to bring in an individual or a team of people to sift through data to compile scouting report and to assist to choose a euphemism the manager with recruitment the day of a coach being allowed to bring in player on a whim are overit is not a perfect system but it is designed to prevent a club having to resort to lastminute purchase desperate roll of the dice it is structured to make club le wasteful more efficient it corollary is that it attracts manager more accustomed to working with what they have or what they are given rather than demanding money be spent to solve problem that have proved beyond themand this is it effect a handful of unremarkable deal player brought in to cover a particular need rather than to meet a vague desire over the course of a month that doe not warrant the comic childlike pomp and ceremony england usually reserve for the transfer window a dull january is not a cause for concern it is not a sign of a lack of ambition but the hallmark of a league that is getting that little bit smarter that at last is thinking with it head rather than it pocketfollow

th liga goal of the season he had reached that mark every year for the last year no player had done that beforeit is a fairly common occurrence of course messi breaking a record he broke two others in december reaching the most win for barcelona overtaking xavi hernández and becoming the first player to score liga goal in consecutive season november by contrast wa quiet he only broke one for champion league goal scored for a single clubsometimes he etches his name on significant milestone highest scorer in spanish history most goal in a calendar year and sometimes his feat seem more like statistical quirk curious piece of trivia no player ha scored two goal in more la liga game than messi for example all of the record though serve a testament to his greatness each one offer further proof of the consistency of his brillianceand yet the more record he break the more remarkable his career becomes the le impact each new mark ha messis scaling height previously thought unimaginable surpassing mark once deemed indelible is now so frequent a to be mundane messi rewriting the history book is the natural order of thing his excellence ha been normalizedwhat he ha done in effect is a sort of impish argentine equivalent to what in politics is known a shifting the overton window in public discourse it refers to the gradual process of taking concept previously considered unthinkable and making them first seem feasible and then finally ordinarythe messi effect work on the same line before he and cristiano ronaldo made a habit of scoring unfathomable number of goal it wa assumed that such tally were impossible the more they have done it the more they have made it seem attainable the more attainable it seems the le special it looksif the worst consequence of the phenomenon for messi is that his splendor is occasionally a little underappreciated something that is more of a loss for those watching than it is for him for others suffering the same genius fatigue the consequence can be more severethis week tottenham face burnley chelsea and arsenal in the premier league it must most likely win all three game to keep within touching distance of manchester city and liverpool in england rocketfueled title raceso fine are the margin that even a single slip may prove fatal and once again condemn spur manager mauricio pochettino and his team to accusation that they lack the cutting edge the carat mass to shine among the elite pochettino like messi will suffer because of the standard he ha setit is worth considering though the nature of tottenham when pochettino took over in that tottenham wa a team deep in the shadow of it two fiercest rival arsenal and chelsea one that only occasionally featured in the champion league one that few even among it most ardent fan considered genuine contender for the premier league titleover the course of pochettinos almost five season at the club all of that ha been transformed tottenham is now certainly a better team than either arsenal or chelsea it ha become a fixture in the champion league with a place in this season quarterfinal well within it graspsince pochettino took charge only one team manchester city ha won more point in the premier league twice tottenham ha mounted sustained challenge for a first english championship since this season it ha managed to cling to the coattail of city and liverpool both of whom have more point at this stage of the season than all but a handful of team in historygiven those circumstance the season pochettino ha overseen thus far may rank a his finest yet when the transfer window closed on jan tottenham became the first team in premier league history not to add a single player over the course of an entire campaignif that parsimony wa extreme it wa not out of character since pochettino arrived in may tottenham ha spent barely half of the amount lavished on manchester city and manchester uniteds squad the sale of midfielder mousa dembélé in january meant that since pochettino arrived the club ha invested le than million net in the transfer marketon several occasion in recent month that ha seemed set to curtail the club ambition pochettino ha had to navigate several week without harry kane and dele alli the lodestar of his attack because of injury in january he lost son heungmin the captain of south korea national team to the asian cup toothe club continues unhappily to play it home game at wembley after a series of delay on the completion of it new stadium now likely to be available in april at the very earliest though even pochettino seems to suspect even that target is ambitious he suggested earlier this month that it would be tough to play there before the start of next seasonthat tottenham is still there then it breath on the neck of manchester city and liverpool yet again is a remarkable feat and yet just a with messi it doe not always feel a though it is celebrated a suchpochettino like messi ha changed the parameter of a conversation he ha made the extraordinary ordinary it wa previously unthinkable that spur might be title contender now it is not just accepted but almost expected indeed the question more often posed to pochettino is whether his team is falling short because it doe not yet have a trophy to show for it progressthere is some validity to that question a the sky sport commentator jamie carragher pointed out earlier this season when this tottenham team come to be remembered fan will not take into account where it played it home game or how much wa spent to reinforce it they will simply ask what it won but it is hard to avoid the feeling that it relevance is overplayedsoccer like all sport is about the creation of collective memory that is why england continues to hold it twin cup competition in such high esteem though winning them is often not enough to save a coach job or build a player reputation or slake a fan thirst for success it is why pochettinos bullish disregard for them in word if not always in action strike such a discordant note among many commentatorsbut soccer is also about pride and status what pochettino ha done is restore both to tottenham that is not some meaningless intangible it ha concrete consequence both in the stadium the club is building a monument to it new reality and the player it will at some point be able to attract therepochettino ha not won anything but he ha created a club that expects and is expected to do so in the future he ha fundamentally altered the fabric of the place that he found he ha made what wa once unthinkable entirely feasible and he ha done it so often that his brilliance ha become mundane it is easy to be fooled into thinking this is normal it is not and the best measure of how extraordinary it is may

the more recent one is visible or rather invisible at this month asian cuptemperatures in the tournament which is being played in the united arab emirate can be stifling making the sight of some chinese player wearing longsleeved undershirt beneath their jersey seem puzzlingthe answer lie in a semiofficial edict from chinese sport official issued last year that ban tattoo from being visible during match the directive applies to the national team but also to chinese player in domestic competition like the chinese super leaguesoccer is now a national priority under president xi jinping and china soccer authority expect the country best player to promote positive value to the next generation of athlete and their parent some of whom remain wary of allowing their child to play a sport they consider to be dangerous or worse frivolous in many way the notattoos rule is a microcosm of the neverending wrestling match that china central government conduct with it sometimesdueling allegiance to modernity and controlthe rule can be more onerous for some player than for others take the heavily inked central defender zhang linpeng most of his body including the entirety of both arm is heavily tattooed he ha been playing with a compression shirt underneath his national team jersey at the asian cup though he ha avoided covering the marking on his right leg and his neckother player have le work to do a tattooed back or calf is often covered by a player uniform while a smaller bit of artwork can be hidden under athletic tape zhang and others have managed to get some respite covering tattoo isnt mandatory for training sessionsthe chinese soccer federation and tournament organizer clearly do not want to talk about the issue however at a news conference before a game with south korea this week that will decide top spot in group c a tournament official tried to shut down a question about the tattoo before the chinese national team coach marcello lippi of italy could answer itafter it wa rephrased lippi gave a short diplomatic response saying he wa not unduly concerned by the edict the team captain zheng zhi sitting to lippi right stifled a laugh but declined to comment on the issuethis is only a detail i dont really want to talk about this lippi said through a translatora few month before the ink ban wa imposed on chinese soccer player television star faced similar restriction a part of government effort to control what viewer were being exposed to in the medium the soccer rule were brought in so quickly though that some club simply chose to heavily bandage their player before they took the fieldthe tattoo ban ha become a lively topic on chinese social medium many people in china appear to support the official view that the player are public figure and should act accordingly others have ridiculed the move which is at odds with a current trend in western sport where elaborate tattoo are now a commonplace a cleat and jersey zlatan ibrahimovic of the los angeles galaxy is covered by them barcelona lionel messi now ha a long sleeve of art on his right arm and another on his left legzhang a defender considered one of china best player did not play in two nationalteam match after the tattoo ban wa established in march the official reason wa injury but angry fan speculated on social medium that china had been thrashed in match against wale and the czech republic because it wa forced to play without zhang who they suspected had been benched because of his body artchina ha been pumping million of dollar into soccer since a sleepy national league is now backed by some of the country biggest company whose lavish spending quickly attracted worldclass coach and player in search of some of the biggest payday in the sport a more intense focus is on creating a national team capable of transforming itself from a punch line into a force that can compete with the best in asia and eventually against the best in the worldthe road to get there ha been bumpy though with soccer official typically political figure chopping and changing policy or introducing rule that some have found hard to followlast year for example top

of cristiano ronaldo and luka modric of zinedine zidane and florentino pérez will be immortalized a the team that wa champion of europe for more than a thousand day the first team since to repeat a european champion the first since to win the european cup three time in a row the winner of four of the last five edition of club soccer most prestigious tournamentit will be remembered a a team that built an empire and defined an era a team that swept all before it right up until the point that a vibrant fearless ajax amsterdam arrived at the santiago bernabéu and brought it all crashing down in one night the dutch team victory in the last on tuesday sending real madrid out and shock wave around europebut though the score line the extent of the rout a much a the identity of the team that administered it wa eyecatching the fact that it felt like an impossibility is to an extent a trick of the memoryreal madrid dominance of the champion league ha been more fragile than the trophy cabinet and history book make it look lifting the club th th th and th european cup wa not an inevitability the manifest destiny of a club that think of itself a the king of europethe best example is the first real madrid wa a few second from losing that final against atlético madrid in lisbon only a rdminute equalizer from sergio ramos took the game to extra time and gave real madrid a reprievebut there are more far more in just a few month into zidanes tenure a coach real traveled to wolfsburg for a quarterfinal it seemed a favorable draw a close to a gim me a the champion league offer at that stage real madrid wa down within minute and secured a place in the semifinal only in the th minute of the second leg with ronaldo striking a pose a he celebrated his hat trick real would win the tournament that year beating atlético again in the final in milan this time on penalty kicksthe next year it progress to the final in cardiff wa stately serene but that final hurdle wa anything but real eventually beat juventus but if that implies an overwhelming superiority it did not feel like that inside the principality stadium indeed for a time after mario mandzukic had drawn juventus even in the first half real madrid seemed to be swaying it player would later admit that they needed to regroup at halftimeand then last year when real almost conspired to throw away a threegoal lead against juventus in their quarterfinal edged past bayern munich in the semifinal thanks to a momentary lapse in concentration and ability from the standin goalkeeper sven ulreich and then overcame liverpool and the even more hapless loris karius in the final in kievnone of that of course is to suggest that real ha ridden it luck or to lessen the significance or glory of it triumph or to claim that what happened against ajax on tuesday a the bernabéu bypassed the rage it usually reserve for defeat and fell straight into grief wa only a matter of timereal madrid deserves it place in history and it most recent generation merit it reputation a a dynasty team one perfectly calibrated in talent and temperament to excel on soccer most exalted stage but that history doe not need to be airbrushed to have all trace of blemish surgically removedit ha been tempting these last few year to see all of real madrid close shave it flirtation with disaster a proof of inherent greatness a team that know exactly what to do to win that always find something more when it is required a group of player whose gift can guide them out of any situationthat is true too though it is not the whole truth what wolfsburg and juventus and ulreich and the rest prove is that real madrid grip on the competition wa not a viselike a it seemed it wa at time only the bounce of a ball away from being loosened entirely what ajax did on tuesday juventus might have achieved a year ago but for one moment one slip one whistlethose blemish matter not because they can be deployed a false harbinger of what wa to come against ajax or because they serve to diminish real madrid status but because they act a proof that all those trophy were achieved not because of destiny but because of the player and coach involvedreal madrid doe not have a divine right to win the champion league it wa not carried to lisbon and milan and cardiff and kiev and to constant glory by it reputation or it aura or it history it wa carried by ronaldo his significance only highlighted by his absence and his own refusal to countenance defeat his desperate quest for greatness and by zidane and before him by carlo ancelotti and his subtle shrewd unspoken ability to elicit the best from the bestreal madrid could easily not have won four of the last five champion league at time it ha been hard to explain particularly in an age when soccer is enthralled by complexity by philosophy and system quite how it ha done so perhaps that is why it ha been so easy to revert to thought of a special bond between this club and this competition to start to believe in destiny how easily it might all have come apart wa illustrated perfectly on tuesday how fragile even the supreme can be that it did not for so

forward again in expectation rather than hopegundogan flick the ball over arsenal defensive line disorientated straight back to sterling it look like creativity like gundogan is extemporizing because that is what we want it to be because that would make it somehow magical but the chance are it is exactly the opposite he will have played that ball and sterling will have made that run a thousand time in training until the timing is perfect and pep guardiola is satisfiedonly a few second have elapsed but the trap ha been set sterling is in down the left side of arsenal penalty area and sergio agüero know where he ha to go where he is meant to be by now it seems from the crowd to be effortless almost telepathic but it is mechanical really agüero ha materialized at the far post the ball is at his foot the goal is openthat wa the second of the three goal that agüero and manchester city scored in a victory against arsenal on sunday though it wa not especially different in style from the first or the third the only real variation the only distinguishing mark wa how he chose to convert he put the first past bernd leno with his head the second with his foot and the third though the referee martin atkinson did not spot it with the help of his armthere wa a sense of inevitability about all three of them a dread predictability not because arsenal with it new manager and it handful of new player and it new dawn after year of elegant decline under arsène wenger is still at heart the most generous and most accommodating of opponent but because that goal is now city hallmark it

reassertion of identity and there is no better expression of that identity of what this city team is or of what it manager would like it to be than that second goal we have scored a lot like that guardiola said after the gamethat is something of an understatement no team in the premier league ha scored more goal from cutback this season according to the analytics company opta of city goal this year have been scored from inside the yard box city score that goal so often that it ha become it default setting here it felt almost like it wa a comfort blanket this city team artful devastating version of going back to basic guardiolas player do not have to think to score that goal they can do it on autopilotthat wa true during the manager time at barcelona and at bayern munich too of course more than city goal it is guardiolas perhaps in time just a a chipped penalty ha become known a a panenka for the man who made it famous a farpost tapin from a low cross will take his namehe ha done more than anyone else after all to evangelize it effectiveness according to his journalistic confidante martí perarnau guardiola ha always agreed with his erstwhile barcelona teammate miquel soler that a hard low cross across the yard box is a goal halfscoredit is the goal he encouraged jordi alba and dani alves to help create at barcelona though neither needed much encouragement it is the goal he schooled arjen robben and franck ribéry in assisting in germany his only acquiescence to the differing quality of the two squad being that he allowed the latter pair to cross the ball in the air rather than along the ground sometimesit is the goal that ha characterized city success too since he arrived here time one of his player ha scored from inside the yard box in his time in england it is a if guardiola ha discovered a glitch in soccer software a gamer who ha found a cheat that work every timeunai emery the arsenal manager would have known that is what guardiola would try to do what

manchester city he said around christmas is the best team in the world a few week later he said he had tried to find a weakness in guardiolas team and come up shortthis is not the usual timbre of discourse in a premier league title race particularly one so delicately poised that at this late stage a single misstep from one would most likely hand the crown to the other much more familiar is the sort of playground psychological warfare practiced by alex ferguson and josé mourinho where every word wa a provocationinitially then it wa easy to assume that klopp and guardiola were simply trying to kill each other with kindness even if it wa not immediately clear what advantage for example klopps describing manchester city a the best team in the world might confer on liverpoolso powerful is the legacy of ferguson so deepseated the obsession with mind game that it ha taken a while to realize that there are no thorn hidden among the garland to remember that praise can have a function other than piling pressure on an opponent not everything is a play klopp admires the team guardiola ha built guardiola respect the transformation klopp ha overseen it is the same among the player virgil van dijk ha voted for raheem sterling a player of the year the ultimate destination of the title will not change that compliment can be sincerewith the race so tight liverpool point ahead at the moment but city with a game in hand that mutual admiration doe not extend to the fan of the two club of course there is no particular historical enmity between manchester city and liverpool but over the last year a distinctly modern rivalry ha started to take shapeat first it seemed to manifest primarily online performative and pointscoring in which liverpool resented city wealth ambition and relevance and city chafed at liverpool history and fame over the last year that ha changed bleeding into the threedimensional world invoked in song that sweep down from the stand at the etihad stadium in particularthe great flash point of course wa the attack on manchester city team bus outside anfield before last year meeting in the champion league quarterfinal an act met with outright and understandable fury by city the direct competition between the team this season the fact that their fortune are so inextricably intertwined ha served only to oxidize iteven a the animus on the outside ha hardened relation on the inside remain cordial when an article appeared earlier this year suggesting fenway sport group liverpool owner wa leading a campaign to persuade the premier league to investigate manchester city breach of financial fair play rule liverpool moved quickly to offer city assurance that wa not the casethe connection are even closer among the staff two of liverpool senior scout dave fallow and barry hunter were recruited from city so too wa lee nobes the head physiotherapist mona nemmer klopps head of nutrition worked with guardiola at bayern munich and made such an impression that when he first arrived in england guardiola asked if the club might be able to share her expertiserodolfo borrell a key member of guardiolas coaching staff meanwhile made his name at barcelona but wa first brought to england by liverpool he spent more than four year on merseyside before moving to city in darren hughes the lead coach at city academy is among three staff member hired from liverpool the same yearthere is a limit to those bond of course there is a lingering sense among some at city that liverpool is offered preferential treatment by the news medium ha a larger contingent of former player in television studio than is easily justified and receives rather more coverage than it recent achievement warrant after the team waited three decade for a championship liverpool desperation is plain for city the pleasure of a fourth title in seven year would be heightened by the identity of it vanquished opponentin a way though each team should be grateful for the other city excellence ha served to accelerate liverpool improvement persuading fenway sport group to make alisson becker briefly the world most expensive goalkeeper and to turn van dijk into the costliest defender in history city had set such high standard that there wa simply no other choice but to invest anything else would have been acquiescence to fateand while manchester city fan might have found last season procession to the title when city became the first team in history to record point substantially le stressful liverpool emergence a a genuine rival ha not diminished city greatness rather it ha accentuated itliverpool remains on course to record the finest season in term of result in it history if it win four of it five remaining game it will have completed at least the third finest campaign in english history bettered only by city last year and potentially city thispicking up a century of point last year won guardiolas team lavish warranted praise in those slow week before the world cup it precise place in the pantheon wa debated ad nauseam wa this the greatest team the premier league had seen how did it stand in comparison to arsenal invincibles of or manchester uniteds treble winnersretaining the title would strengthen it case of course and doing so in these circumstance would only compound it reaching point with the rest of the competition ground into dust wa impressive but it wa also somehow detached abstract a mountain rising sheer and inexplicable out of a desert city had to create a challenge for itself because none emerged elsewhere the strength of liverpool challenge this year would offer scale and context to city peakmore important though it ha injected some emotion into it in guardiolas mind there is such a thing a the perfect goal a move in which each of his player touch the ball once flowing from goalkeeper to striker before someone applies a finish he dream of dominance uninterrupted he seek perfection he want to render his opponent irrelevantthat is what happened last season at no point wa there a threat to city quiet surgical dissection of the premier league there wa no disturbance no jeopardy just the serene progress of a team with the ball from one end of the season to the other guardiola is the finest coach of his generation because he aim for that city is the best team in the world because it can achieve itit is of no concern to guardiola that it may not be especially entertaining to watch not just for the dispirited fan of his latest victim or the putative elusive neutral but after a while perhaps even for the fan of his own team each game finished off inside minute the other nothing more than killing time opponent too cowed even to try to defy the odds little risk of defeat and a superiority so absolute that there are few consequence of one anyway guardiola want to produce art and should be praised for it but art is not the same thing a sportalmost to the end liverpool ha ensured that ha not happened a klopp ha said countless time it is almost his mantra now city ha not been able to get rid of his team not yetit ha not been allowed to turn the premier league into a month victory parade there ha been throughout the season a very real sense of jeopardy that is why klopp and guardiola have traded bouquet rather than barb there ha been no need for the soap opera of mind game what liverpool and city have crafted is something infinitely more compelling two team trying to prove they are worthy of the others admiration to live up to the

solskjaer uniteds caretaker manager solbakken and glazer spoke during the game solskjaer and glazer talked after itthe rumor by that stage had been swirling for a while the whisper quickly growing into scream first that the permanent manager position wa solskjaers to lose then that united wa wavering on it desire to appoint mauricio pochettino of tottenham hotspur this summer and finally that the decision had already been made that solskjaer then unbeaten in his first game since replacing josé mourinho had taken to life at old trafford so well that the post would be hisseeing glazer and solbakken together followed swiftly by solskjaers admission that he had spoken with the club owner seemed to make it a fait accomplifew thought the end of solskjaers unbeaten start a defeat in the champion league against paris stgermain on tuesday should change any of thatin a matter of week after all the norwegian seemed to have lifted the veil that had descended during mourinhos choleric tenure solskjaer had restored united to something close to what it is supposed to bewhere mourinho had made a habit of criticizing his player in public solskjaer took care to praise every single one of them after a victory against tottenham and pochettino that had been the most impressive of his young reign where mourinho had scowled and sneered through public engagement solskjaer ha the air of a man living a dream goodnatured and goodhumoredwhere mourinho complained endlessly about uniteds transfer strategy and the greater resource enjoyed by his putative rival solskjaer seems to revel in working with player he regard a among the best in the world mourinhos relationship with some had soured so much that his message to the player were often transmitted through kieran mckenna the firstteam coach solskjaer a former united forward ha been giving his striker tip on precise movement and type of finisheven at the executive level the restored joy and the confidence inculcated in the player had proved infectious impossible to resist a ed woodward uniteds executive vice chairman and the man who will ultimately decide on the club permanent managerial appointment said on an investor call this week solskjaer had had a positive impact throughout the clubcommon consensus not to mention common sense had it that the job should be his he had dispelled the myth expertly but inexplicably disseminated by mourinho that uniteds player were not up to scratch he had proved incontrovertibly that what wa holding the club back wa the manager not the squadif that is a seductive view for uniteds fan so delighted to have been rescued by a hero from their golden age it is even more alluring to woodward glazer and the rest of the club hierarchy a remedy that is not only simple but immediate and inexpensiveit is though to be resisted a satisfying not to mention easy a it would be to place all of uniteds recent ill at mourinhos door it would not be a reflection of reality he wa a much symptom a cause of uniteds drift in recent year his departure and solskjaers arrival wa a first step on the way back it should not be confused with the end of the journeylast summer united bowed to the overwhelming trend of the modern era and decided to appoint a technical director someone to fill the role occupied by txiki begiristain at manchester city and by michael edward at liverpool mourinho wa against it but woodward mind wa made uphe wa not though in a rush earlier this season when news medium report linked one potential candidate to the role the executive in question got in touch with woodward to inform him that he wa not the source of the article woodward unruffled told him that he did not expect to make an appointment for two yearsas recently a christmas the idea wa still very much in the planning stage united ha spoken to at least one headhunting firm specialist in sport recruitment to gauge how precisely it might run a process to identify suitable candidate united wa understandably cautious in the meeting asking more question than offering answer it did not make it clear if it wa searching for a recruitment specialist someone to oversee the whole soccer operation or more of a figurehead it had not yet decided whether it needed outside help to appoint any of them it had not ruled out an internal appointment or that it would opt for a former playerthat of course could have been nothing more than professional discretion if it wa not for the fact that many in the club remain unclear even now on how exactly woodward conceives of the rolethe club ha not yet internally decided what title the new appointment if and when it is made will hold or what responsibility the holder will have in the investor call on thursday woodward filibustered we are looking at that role and way we can make it stronger and it is something we will do on a continual basis he saidthat lack of clarity is not ideal united ha been linked with a succession of highprofile name andrea berta of atlético madrid monchi of a rom juventuss fabio paratici ajax edwin van der sar and it ha widely been assumed that all would find the prospect of working at old trafford appealing without a clear codified set of responsibility though all are likely to be put off according to several people who work in sport executive recruitmentunited ha been hamstrung ever since the retirement

cumbersome and conservative structurally resistant to changein that context racing stand out a a bastion of innovation it is not just the homemade footbonaut it is the support available to the boy who live at the club academy far in advance of what most of their peer in argentina would be offered ranging from social worker and psychologist to academic tutor it is the approach to player development

the help of a few agent huerta said there is no process everything change constantly and there are time when crucial decision are made by someone who doe not know anything about footballracing however is determined to be another type of club weiner said we have to be creative he said we have to have a network that mean we can get player before bigger club because financially we can not compete with

again he is on the cusp of doing just that racing sits atop argentina superleague a first title since inching ever closer it journey though directed by milito ha been unorthodoxall the time milito wa in europe he saw how they were working and he tried to adapt some of the idea he found huerta said scouting wa central to that one of militos first appointment wa weiner who had been working with his father gabriel on his mobile technical unit a freelance scouting operation effectively that carried out project work for european and north american club we had been commissioned by bayer leverkusen udinese chicago fire and a few others javier weiner said a racing fan he leapt at the chance to sign up permanently when milito asked huertas route wa a little different a journalist by training he spent four year working at clarín argentina biggest news outlet before starting to work with martí perarnau once an olympian for spain and now a prolific journalist author and the biographer of pep guardiolahuertas connection with perarnau allowed him to visit several of europe most progressive club i talked to people from dortmund sevilla barcelona olympique marseille he said i went to watch zinedine zidane while he wa coaching real madrid reserve team i had read soccernomics and moneyball i had some idea on how to run a clubhe started doing video analysis and statistic work for racing when milito arrived he spotted huertas gift for language and recruited him into his inner circle he now act a a bridge between the scouting operation the first team and the academy we did not have a structure before huerta said now we have a clear vision of what we want the club to bethe best parallel he can find is with one of those club he visited on his tour of europe sevilla a team that ha built sustained modern success among much bigger rival by recruiting well and selling betterracing ha always had a reputation for youth development the club is known in argentina a la academia and that remains central to militos plan in his office at the academy huerta keep a map of all the area of argentina where he ha searched for talentthere ha never been any shortage of that of course

mistake we make because no matter how badly we do thing player come through gomis saidthere is a focus now not on training talent the endless slew of creative attacking player that argentina is famous for but on position of concept the more defensive more cerebral role we want to create the player that racing need said claudio úbeda a coach at the academy but also the player that europe wantsracing is looking further afield than any of it rival for that raw material it is huerta said often the only argentine team that sends scout to international youth tournament it ha started to recruit player

turned out they were scout from fc copenhagen in denmark there wa nobody to help them get ticket to watch a player so they just ended up behind the goal we have changed that nowso new that there remains some suspicion about it the concept of scouting remains alien to some huerta is regularly asked by colleague from other team why he is bothering to watch lower tier game or follow player from

it host real madrid in the last of the champion league on wednesday de ligt will marshal the defense de jong will orchestrate the attacksonly one of the seven will be absent kluivert resisted the emotional overture to follow in his father footstep he refused to extend his contract and wa sold to rom at ajax they understand why he made that decision the allure for a teenager with a famous name of forging his own path but when they mention kluivert now it is with a hint of regret a tinge of frustrationnot because he left but because he left so soon if a player go after just half a year in the first team like kluivert we are disappointed said said ouaali the director of de toekomst ajax famed youth academyin january ajax made another video this time it wa for public consumption posted on the club social medium channel it wa a little more than a minute long but it showcased all of what erik ten hag ajax current manager called de jong special quality it wa titled frenkie futuro and wa released to celebrate the confirmation of the yearolds move to barcelona set to be completed this summerde jong is the shining light of this ajax team a player so promising that he ha more than once been compared to johan cruyff himself yet there wa no regret at his departure barcelona enjoy the future like we do ajax wrote on it official twitter accountthe feeling will be the same this summer when de ligt a player who ha been at ajax since he wa departs a he is expected to do a yearold defender who is regarded by some premier league scout a the best prospect in any position in world soccer de ligt could join his friend at barcelona or he might end up at juventuseither way there will be no sadness no sense of loss at what might have been ten hag might allow himself to wonder a little he said at what could happen if i could keep them for two or three year into their prime but that is iti will be proud he said the scout who found them will be proud marc overmars will be proud everyone will be if they transfer to a big club you are happy for themthis is of course what ajax ha always done since cruyff himself left for barcelona in it ha churned out a stream of talent for others to enjoy johan neeskens marco van basten frank rijkaard clarence seedorf edgar david kluivert wesley sneijder rafael van der vaart eriksen ibrahimovic jan vertonghen luis suárez the ajax alumnus list read like a who who of modern soccerthe formula that ha allowed it to do so hang on the wall in ten hag office opposite a series of blackandwhite portrait of rinus michels the mastermind of the great team of the s cruyff it star and louis van gaal the man who restored ajax to the european pinnacle in the s with a team reared almost entirely at de toekomstten hag laugh when he look at that wall they set you a standard he said blowing out his cheek but he is serious when he discus the ajacied a cross between a mission statement and a creed for the clubthese are the trait the club seek to instill in every player who wear it jersey or who pass through de toekomst a well a it coach and staff there are of them they have been arranged like a team this being ajax they are set out in a formation they range from taking responsibility and initiative to remaining disciplined and having funthe approach clearly work no team in europe produce more professional player than ajax the club figure put it ahead of partizan belgrade and dynamo kyiv according to ouaali a staggering percent of player who are at de toekomst at age will go on to have pro careersbut that is not to say it ha not been adapted altered finetuned over the year that process started in when cruyff returned to a club that in van der sars word did not feel like ajax anymore cruyff and the cadre of former player he brought with him wanted not only to restore the focus on youth development to shed highly paid aging player but to change the way ajax workedwe focus always on the individual ouaali said we dont think about age group like the dutch federation or like other club it can be hard for coach because they want result a well to be successful to be promoted to the next step up but we try to find coach who focus on the development of player who learn the individual not the teamthe club recognized too that it had to work faster than before player were no longer staying in the eredivisie until they were or they were leaving at or if not earlier at they needed to be ready to play in the first team ten hag said because at they are gonethat meant more physical work at younger age and an end to player going to school outside ajax now they study at de toekomst so they can maximize the hour they spend in the classroom and on the training fieldajax borrowed method found in montessori education to mix age group and it under team wa abolished to increase pressure on the talent ouaali saidthe club second team jong ajax which play in dutch soccer second tier no longer would be filled with senior player now most of it member are still in their teenage year we had to speed up the process ten hag said they had to be good quickerall of it wa a formal acknowledgment of ajax place in the st century soccer firmament it is telling for example that ouaali see his job and that of de toekomst not a to produce player for the first team but to produce them for ajax then the dutch national team then the top international levelthe order is important ajax is not just about developing player it is also concerned with winning van der sar in particular wa keenly aware of the need to keep it protégés long enough to benefit from them it is why he ha loosened the wage budget enough to make staying around for an extra year or two appealing it is why the club is seeking to expand it global footprint opening an office in new york agreeing to run a youth system at guangzhou rf the chinese super league team finding way to monetize it namede jong and de ligt have done what they were asked to do when they watched that video last summer they might not have won a trophy but by carrying ajax to the last of the champion league to a meeting with real madrid they have given something back a van der sar put itwhen they and possibly other member of the seven depart they will go with the best wish of the club and then the whole system will start againthat after all is ajax real gift it ability not to produce one player or one generation of them but to keep on going it is what make player leaving not only desirable but necessarywe have to give the path to the next one van der sar said if player stay too long the next one can not play the whole thing chokeshe cited an example from just a couple of year ago davy klaassen wa ajax captain then he wa the club had high hope for a young midfielder donny van der beek but he needed a place to playdonny wa saying ok davy come on now it your time to go van der sar saidklaassen did go to everton on wednesday van der beek will be in midfield against

bounced and sang and roared mario mandzukic turned inside and floated a cross into atlético madrid boxhe misjudged the weight of the pas just a little a few inch too high for his target federico bernardeschi and maybe a yard or so behind him no matter it wa one opportunity lost another would surely soon be on it waybernardeschi though wa not quite so quick to write it off he adjusted his run twisted his body planted his right foot and leaped upward swinging his left leg towards the ball making contact full and thickit would have been some goal the sort that would belong in a computer game or a comic book instead it skimmed the outside of jan oblaks net the crowd purred in appreciation of what might have beenthe mere attempt wa fantastical really a shot with such a slim chance of success one that required such precise measurement of vision and technique and timing one that any halfdecent analyst would tell you wa not worth the bother most player would have written off the idea a soon a it had occurred to themthat bernardeschi did not say a lot about him of course his wa a performance brimming with intent and ambition and no little skill but it offer a little insight too into the nature of the modern champion leaguethis is a competition that ha in recent year discarded the very notion of unlikely with every year that pass it seems to stretch the bound of credulity a little further to demand an even greater suspension of disbelief it is infused now with a sense of fantasy there is something in the air on these night that encourages player and team to give something to give anything a go it is a competition of youneverknow of whynot it is the place where those overhead kick go inindeed by recent standard it is hard to categorize what happened here on tuesday a any sort of seismic shock yes juventus recovered from two goal down in the first leg to win by and reach the quarterfinal yes atlético madrid for so long regarded a soccer most obdurate unyielding opponent the sport great immovable object collapsed into itself diego simeones player succumbing to their fate with barely a whimperof course juventuss progression wa improbable but it did not feel impossible even beforehand in part that can be attributed to the mere presence of ronaldo the player juventus signed because the club hierarchy believed him to be a close to a guarantee in this competition a can be imaginedronaldo had scored only one goal in his last nine champion league game a ha been the case every year for the last few it had become acceptable to wonder if his brilliance wa starting to fadeno a it turn out this is his stage and these are his game he come alive when the world is watching when there is a chance to be a hero he feed off it obviously he wa going to score the goal two towering header that drew juventus level and who else exactly wa going to take the penalty won by bernardeschi that sent manager massimiliano allegris team throughbut it wa not simply the confidence that come with the player who is by almost every metric the greatest champion league player of all time that fed juventuss conviction allegris player need only to have seen what happened last week ajax eliminating real madrid after losing the first leg at home manchester uniteds reserve eliminating paris stgermain after losing the first leg at home to feel that their task wa not too onerousthose are just the most recent example last year rom overturned a threegoal deficit against no le than barcelona to reach the semifinal juventus itself even without ronaldo lost by to real madrid in turin and then build a threegoal lead in the santiago bernabéu in the return before a late penalty brought it all to a crushing closeand of course month earlier came the most remarkable of them all barcelona comeback to recover from four goal down against psg sergi roberto scoring in the final minute of more than one of the most expensive team ever assembled humiliated and cowedit is worth asking why these result keep happening why a competition that once wa marked by it caution and it caginess ha become so chaotic allegri wa not particularly in the mood to do so tuesday these thing have always happened he said though he did suggest that the quality of the team a well a the sense of a second chance even after a firstleg defeat might feed into it and perhaps all of those precedent too have persuaded player that there is no such thing a a lost causebut that is only telling one side allowing the victor to write history what explains the gulf in performance over the course of two game for the losing team for atlético and real madrid and invariably psg is it complacency the converse of the avenging energy of the defeated is it the exposure of some fatal flaw is it an inherent respect for the epicor is it a luka milivojevic a serb midfielder for crystal palace put it earlier this season something to do with the nature of the challenge a team like lyon he explained is able to carry a game to manchester city in the champion league in a way that could not happen domestically because it is used to having the initiative it default mode is to have the ballthat is true of almost all of the team in europe elite competition they are unaccustomed even atlético whose reputation for doughty defending is rooted in it performance against real barcelona and in the champion league to ceding controlthat tends to make game much more open much more exciting much more chaotic and when an opponent can wrest the momentum from them it make them much more vulnerable they are placed in a situation they do not have a great deal of experience in handling they are powerless to resist perhaps that is what ha created this version of the champion league where anything can happen where improbable is not enough and impossible might not be too where it is worth giving something no matter how fantastical a goan earlier version of this article misstated the

midfield hope phil foden after yet another routine premier league winsilva is both in private and in public a quiet soul he doe not court the limelight he consent to only one regular interview opportunity a year a brief chat to promote tourism on the canary island where he grew up in which he doe his best to say nothing or especially enjoy being the center of attentionwith fodens mother claire though he wa effusive he told her what a pleasure it wa to train alongside her teenage son and enthused at the prospect of just how good a player he thought foden could becomeless than a year after foden had made his debut for city silva said he wa already convinced that the yearold had the potential to go on to be one of the best player in the world his only hope he told her wa that she might ask her son to wait a couple of year before blossoming just to give me a chance he saidthere is a timeless quality to silva he turn next week but still seems the player he wa when he first arrived in manchester almost nine year ago he is no le sharp no le lively no le fluent always in motion a his one time spain teammate javi martinez once said he still wear his brilliance lightly he still see no need to indulge in ornament or ostentation his is a genius for simple thing done to perfectionto his coach pep guardiola silva is a joy to work with to his teammate a kyle walker put it he is an example he ha been a central figure at city ever since he arrived in but if anything he is even more integral now charged with knitting together all of the complex passing pattern guardiola ha drummed into his playersit is no surprise that it wa in his absence a well a that of fernandinho another of city old stager because of a leg injury that city lost to crystal palace and leicester city offering liverpool daylight at the summit of the premier league and turning the two team meeting at the etihad stadium on thursday into a game silva and his teammate must win if we drop point it over almost impossible guardiola said this weekeven city with all it resource lack something in silva absence he is one of the most incredible player in the world at playing in the pocket guardiola said of his playmaker earlier this season he is maybe the strongest in the world in those space we try to attack those space he is a master of it few player can do itsilvas talent is not his only source of influence around the same time he wa greeting fodens mother silva presented each of his teammate with a personalized nintendo switch console inscribed with their initial and two game silva is not much of a gamer himself but he knew many of the younger player are he felt the chance to play alongside and against each other might help the team bond on away tripsthe gesture wa not advertised or announced to the team the gift came a a surprise silva made it a he play a pas with delicacy and discretion not for it own sake but toward a greater goalthose are the trait on which he ha built his career that have led him to a world cup title two european championship and three premier league title but they are the characteristic too that may stop him from receiving the individual recognition he perhaps deservesroberto mancini one of guardiolas predecessor at city and the manager who brought silva to england from valencia in always regarded his playmaker a the equal of xavi and andrés iniesta if he had gone to barcelona in mancini said everyone would be saying he is one of the best player in the worldsilva ha rarely if ever been mentioned in that conversation even in dispatch indeed remarkably in nine year in england he ha only once back in september managed to be voted the premier league player of the month he ha won that award a often a such luminary a nikica jelavic adam le fondre and connor wickham he ha needle to say never been voted the country player of the yearand yet there is a case to be made that silva rank not just among the finest player of this premier league generation but among the greatestever import into english soccertrue he can not match the transformative effect eric cantona had on the game when he arrived first at leeds united in and then at manchester united and true he ha not scored a frequently or played a explosively a the like of thierry henry or didier drogbahe may not be a decorated a peter schmeichel who picked up five premier league title at manchester united or produced a many moment of jawdropping wonder a dennis bergkamp unlike cristiano ronaldo he ha not led his team to the champion league crown or gone on to score more goal in that competition than anyone elsethere are other way though to gauge greatness never mind that silva ha won more premier league title than henry and a many a ronaldo and patrick vieiramuch more significant is the fact that over the last decade nobody ha created more goal in the premier league than the elfin spaniard only two foreign player bergkamp and cesc fàbregas have more assist in english historynever mind that he ha lasted longer in the tumult of english soccer than almost any of his rival candidate only vieira remains ahead of him for now far more important is that he ha done so despite being adjudged in some quarter a too lightweight for the fray when he first arrived silva ha not uniquely but more than most changed the way the premier league see itself he ha played a role in ending the tyranny of the powerhouse he ha not just helped to define and refine the playing style with which city is now synonymous but proved that small technical player can thrive in englandyou can see his quality from how long he ha survived in the premier league guardiola said if you survive it is because you are a better player when he move it is clever more intelligent when you see thing like he doe it is because you are more intelligent than the othersthat he is so easily overlooked when alan shearer nominated a player to enter that pantheon last year he went for silva teammate sergio agüero is in part because of the person silva is shy private not given to grand public declaration of his geniusbut it is also because of the player he is silva doe not pretend to be a great soloist he doe not play to the gallery or for his personal highlight reel he is not especially quick or frighteningly strong or ruthlessly productivehe is instead an embodiment of that old guardiola maxim he take the ball he pass the ball the better he play the brighter others shine it ha been easy to lose sight of him a player who seek nothing but to be a part of the collective but he ha always been at the heart of itit is hard to tell but he is slowly descending from the peak he ha occupied for almost a decade even he think he ha just a couple of year left before he is replaced he may be right foden may go on to be one of the best in the world silva though will prove a tough act to followadvertisement

burst of speed creates a touch a glimmer of space the ball is at his left foot he touch it just a few inch in front of himmohamed salah ha scored this goal before he seemed to score this goal almost continually last season opening his body out wrapping his foot round the ball generating enough whip to carry it high across the goalkeeper arcing into the far corner it is the goal that won him last year puskas award it is the goal that at one point seemed to become his signaturethe mechanic of it are still there now he set the ball just the same a he used to he shape his body just the same a he used to he is it is safe to assume aiming for the same corner a he used to this time though it is not quite enough the ball curl but it fade too soon it pick up height but too little jordan pickford evertons goalkeeper barely move the ball drift welcome into his armssalah missed more glaring opportunity than that a liverpool just a it had last week visited a team desperate to see it fail and left with a goalless draw the cost wa a little higher this time around a single point against manchester united last week took liverpool to the top of the premier league table the same result against everton on a rainspecked sunday left it a point behind manchester citysalah wa not the only player who might have diverted the course of the game joel matip and fabinho in particular spurned their chance to become folk hero but he did it most often twice once in each half he raced clear his foot a blur a he bore down on goal twice his touch wa heavy twice his timing wa awry pickford saved one the defender michael keane stopped the otherbut though they were his best chance it wa the first of them the one that curled straight into pickford hand that wa most symbolic of salah campaign so far everything is almost exactly the same a it used to be a it wa in his unstoppable season last year only it isnt not quiteit wa of course unavoidable that salah would be accused of suffering from what is popularly known a secondseason syndrome that is the unfortunate thing about setting quite so high a bar last season even the slightest dropoff or even the slightest perception of a dropoff can be interpreted a an anticlimaxanything other than a repeat of the improbable feat of his first season at liverpool goal in premier league game in in all competition would certainly be enough to invite criticism that his run of form had been an illusionso it ha proved salah ha scored goal in the premier league in his game this season good of course respectable obviously more than a goal in every two game still a smart inclusion in the fantasy team clearly is it a total bettered only by sergio agüero putting salah ahead of harry kane and pierreemerick aubameyang and the rest of the billion of dollar of striker in the premier league ok but still not quite the same not reallysalah indeed is a strange kind of busted flush he wa according to his manager jürgen klopp unplayable a recently a four day ago when he twisted and curdled the blood of adam masina watfords left back during a win at anfield he ha been criticized for disappearing in highpressure game not always wrongly but in the one truly doordie game of liverpool season so far in the champion league against napoli salah scored the only goal he is still his club leading scorer even at goodison park even in the stalemate it wa abundantly clear that he wa liverpool greatest threatthat is not to say though that the criticism is entirely misplaced just a salah is not a writeoff because he ha not managed to maintain his furious goalscoring rate it is hard to deny that he is not quite the force of nature he wa for much of last yearperhaps in the early month of the season there were mitigating circumstance the lingering effect of that shoulder injury sustained in the champion league final the one that threatened his involvement in the world cup and that hampered his performance in russiaand perhaps even a the injury ha healed it effect are still felt klopp dismisses any notion that salah ha lost confidence but the heavy touch when he wa once so deft the slight stumble when he wa once so sure they are the surefire signssalahs newfound profile mean he ha to deal with the closer attention of opposing defender he ha had to do so at time in the absence of much creative assistance from liverpool midfield and for much of the year in a new position too he ha not been able to pick up the burden when he is not quite a fluid not quite a free a he used to bethere is no shame in that of course the number of goal he ha scored despite all of that warrant respect rather than scorn the worry from klopps perspective and from liverpool is that in a title race that will probably be decided by the very finest of margin what they need more than ever is the salah of last year the one who scored that same goal again and again the one whose every touch seemed to be golden if liverpool is to overhaul manchester city if

when liverpool fan spotted himthey had been corralled inside the stadium for minute or so after the final whistle until the manchester police had determined it wa safe for them to be accompanied out they had entertained themselves by singing for a while but had gradually fallen quiet a if trying to work out their emotional reaction to the draw they had just seenand then klopp appeared a they lingered in the aisle ringed by steward they turned to salute him liverpool top of the league they sang klopp had spent most of the afternoon with a deepset scowl on his face barking instruction at his player bristling and bubbling with dissatisfactionas he got closer though a he worked out what they were singing he put one hand on his heart on the liverpool crest on his top and with the other offered a little wave he beamed that broad warm smile the one that make him look a little like a happy shark it lingered even a he turned away before he got serious againliverpools day wa a little like that somewhere between a scowl and a smilea draw with manchester united meant a return to the top of the premier league table ahead of manchester city by a single point with game left to playit meant klopps player have now faced the most daunting fixture of their runin against england most inform team united remains unbeaten domestically since ole gunnar solskjaer replaced josé mourinho and a club fizzing with motivation to see liverpool fail that point represented an obstacle clearedthere wa no great sense of relief though no untamed glee among the traveling fan the point also represented an opportunity lost against a united team frayed by injury anthony martial sat in the stand not fit enough to be involved nemanja matic wa ruled out after picking up an injury in trainingby halftime solskjaer had been forced to use all three of his substitute too with ander herrera juan mata and jesse lingard a substitute himself all limping off marcus rashford clearly in discomfort for much of the game wa forced to swallow a couple of painkiller and carry onuniteds midfield for more than an hour consisted of scott mctominay and andreas pereira callow youth forced to bear the responsibility of grizzled experience liverpool would rarely have faced a united team with such threadbare resource with quite so many square peg in round hole it would rarely have found fate smiling so kindly at old trafford that point stood a proof too of liverpool failure to profit from uniteds troublesbut then liverpool season ha been a little like that elusive fuzzy difficult to discern and define a noteworthy for what it is missing a what is presentthe raw number of course are enormously impressive just one defeat all year at manchester city right at the start of january still likely the most significant result of the campaign and more point than it ha ever had at this stage of the premier league more point indeed than all but a handful of team have had at this stage of the seasonliverpool ha the best defense in the country comfortably ahead of manchester city in goal surrendered virgil van dijk would be a contender for the various player of the year award a rarity for a defender only city ha scored more goalsthe best gauge of how impressive liverpool ha been though is that with twothirds of the season gone it remains ahead of a city team so good that pep guardiola it coach ha spent a good part of the last week batting off question about whether it can win all four trophy the mythical unprecedented quadruple this season it picked up the first on sunday beating chelsea on penalty in the efl cup final city is a team that picked up point in winning the title last year and ha at various point been deemed to be even better this time around all of that and liverpool is still on topand yet liverpool doe not look like a team capable of all of that not just here against a weakened manchester united but for considerable swath of the season too city ha a swagger and a panache and an irresistibility liverpool on all but a few occasion ha seemed to toil for every goal and every point and every winit would be easy to see a run of draw in the last few week against leicester city and west ham united and now manchester united and assume that the pressure is telling on klopp and his player unaccustomed to the stress and strain that come with trying to win a league title but in truth those performance were not so different from many of the game liverpool ha won this year the only change wa that liverpool did not somehow pick a way throughin part that is all the fruit of a twin misunderstanding a false comparison liverpool ha been accused of failing to hit the height of last year when it reached the champion league final and appeared uncontrollable at time in the premier leaguebut the memory play trick liverpool wa not always the swashbuckling team of popular imagination last season there were time of drudgery and frustration too and so for that matter doe perception klopp ha made a concerted effort this year to ensure liverpool blow le hot and cold doe not expend too much of it energy in chasing game or swarming team he ha trained his team to run a marathon rather than a series of sprintsthat is why liverpool is on top of the league it is why it feel surprising that liverpool is on top how long that last now depends on whether klopps strategy of trading stamen for speed pay off it depends on which interpretation of liverpool is the more accurate it depends on whether liverpool remaining game are defined by what it is ha or what it doe not it remains a season that could end with a scowl or with a smile the solace for klopp is that it remains liverpool choice to make justadvertisement

advertisementsupported byon soccerby rory smithmanchester england sergi roberto might have noticed lionel messis battle scar first the slightly swollen nose or the faint trace of a bruise flowering around his left eye or he might have realized that the rest of the argentine feature were of far greater concern messis brow wa furrowed his face wa set into a scowl he wa staring straight at his teammate roberto had let him downhis offense wa one scuffed pas a deflating climax to a wonderful flowing move down barcelona right flank a better ball a little more composure and messi would have had a glorious chance to double his team lead not necessarily enough to settle this champion league quarterfinal to doom manchester united but a significant tilting of the balance ahead of next week second leg in barcelona at the camp nouit wa in robertos defense an aberration until that point he had offered poise and drive since coming on a a substitute for arthur the brazilian midfielder he had improved barcelona considerablyby that stage though messi wa in no mood to consider mitigating circumstance his frustration had been building for an hour or so with himself with his teammate with what he very clearly felt wa an overly physical approach from uniteds defender and an excessively lenient one from gianluca rocchi the italian referee through his war wound messi subjected roberto to his sternest glarewhenever barcelona sweep into town it carry with it certain expectation barcelona is style and it is beauty it is treasuring the ball cherishing possession every touch perfect and every pas precise it is attacking intent and artistic sensibility home crowd may not come to enjoy it they may in fact come specifically to disrupt it but they expect at least to admire it teeth gritted and breath takenmuch the same of course go for watching messi he had not graced old trafford for more than a decade united had not encountered him at all since when he orchestrated the defeat of alex fergusons team at wembley in a second champion league finalold trafford wa ready for him on this day though when the team were read out before kickoff there were deafening vituperative jeer for both philippe coutinho and luis suárez both in mancunian eye can be considered forever tainted by their association with liverpool messis name attracted a little opprobrium too not quite the howling chorus reserved for his teammate but not too faroff in his case it felt a little like a compliment a though stopping him would require not just the individual on the field but the or so in the stand tooin some way then manchester uniteds fan would leave the stadium a couple of hour later feeling a though they had done their job messi did create the game only goal of course he did with a darting run a heavy touch and an improvised cross for suárez to head home with the help of a final touch from luke shaw but for long stretch he seemed subduedhe drifted out wide in search of space and success but found neither he dropped deep to try to light some fire in barcelona belly but could muster only ember there were moment of course such is the quality of player messi ha around him that there will always be moment but they were fleeting the goal itself the product of two minute of possession with every visiting player touching the ball chance in the first half for coutinho and in the second after another spell of endless possession of what seemed a thousand pass for suárezby the time roberto had made his poor choice on the edge of manchester uniteds box messi wa feeling frayed he had not lived up to his own expectation and neither had his team though it is hard to separate which one of those is cause and which is consequence either way robertos errant delivery wa the final straw messi glowered and glaredand yet while this victory felt like it came despite rather than because of barcelona performance it wa nevertheless a victory and in some light rather an impressive onebarcelona did not play at all well for long stretch and yet emerged with a lead an away goal and a sense that united had been kept at arm length with comparative ease the home team in fact did not have a single shot on target there were flurry of pressure brief spell when barcelona seemed to be teetering only to be carried to safety by the nous and composure of gerard piqué clément lenglet and sergio busquetsit wa not what we expect of barcelona and judging from messis reaction it is not necessarily what barcelona expects of itself but it showcased many of the trait that the team that go on to win this competition tends to posse maturity cunning patience control and most decisive of all an ability to click even if only briefly and find a gear that an opponent can not matchit is not a comparison that would be especially welcome in catalonia but in that sense it wa a display straight out of the recent playbook of barcelona archrival real madrid a sort of base level of organization laced with enough individual talent to make a difference a superiority that is not immediately visible but that make itself plain by the endperhaps that is no bad thing for the last year barcelona ha always been the most stylish the most gifted the most compelling team in the champion league it is the most immediately recognizable the one that inspires the most fear the one that come with the greatest expectationsit is real madrid that ha won this competition in four of the last five year though at barcelona they worry that the club ha let messi down somehow in only permitting the finest player of his generation or even of all time to win the competition four time throughout his career this may not feel like a vintage barcelona team it may not live up to the expectation imposed upon it if it win though if it lift messis scowl it will not matteradvertisement

line manchester city liverpool the etihad stadium crowd all held their breathand then john stone reached it and sent it a far away from himself from danger a he could anthony taylor the referee checked his watch for the goalline technology reading that would determine if the entire ball had crossed the line before stone reached it he waited everyone waitedhe shook his head the slightest sliver of orange and purple leather had remained above the line le than an inch city could breathe againthe second ball an hour or so later traveled quicker caught sweet by leroy sanés left foot it struck the sole of trent alexanderarnolds boot and flew past alisson beckers outstretched hand it trajectory shifted just enough it struck the bottom of the far post and skittered along the same white line another intake of breath it clipped the foot of the near post this time taylor did not need to look at his wristfine line slender margin liverpool did not score manchester city did liverpool did not win manchester city did it doe not change everything liverpool remains at the top of the premier league four point clear of the reigning champion but when the time come to look back on this season this result may have changed enoughthat is how it felt when taylor blew his whistle confirming that sanés goal had been enough to seal a victory for pep guardiolas team enough to end liverpool game unbeaten run enough to evaporate the faint aura of invincibility that had started to attach itself to jürgen klopps teammanchester city player sank to their knee in ecstasy the stand bounced and heaved guardiola just moment removed from berating martin atkinson the fourth official for some perceived error by taylor embraced his coaching staff and hugged his playersmore from rory smith david silva manchester city key piece is now more valuable than everlater guardiola would be asked if his captain vincent kompany should have been sent off instead of receiving just a yellow card for a firsthalf foul on mohamed salah another fine line another slender margin guardiola did not want to contemplate such a question on a night like this he saidthis wa the moment manager and player and fan had decided on which the whole season would turn when the slightest difference could have seismic consequence guardiola had made clear in the day beforehand that this wa a game manchester city could not afford to loseit would he believed be impossible to catch up to a team a good a liverpool maybe the best in the world he called klopps side trying to kill his foe with kindness if it won and secured a point lead with game to playthe fan clearly felt the same way a city cantered to the championship last season the etihad wa a contented mellow sort of place quietly confident in it own obvious superiority there wa little tension no drama against liverpool under pressure it wa raucous and angry possessed of the same manic energy that infused guardiolas playersby the end that energy had transformed into jubilation trailing liverpool by four point a city doe now is hardly ideal a month ago most people connected to city would have been hardpressed to even imagine such a situation but when the damage could have been so much worse it felt like a blessing city can celebrate all that it ha gained it need not worry about the ground it had lostfour point is a couple of bad afternoon over the course of five long month four point is a lapse of focus in the league because of the demand of the champion league four point is an unfortunate injury or a needle sendingoff it is the bounce of a ball it is a fine line a slender marginit is particularly precarious now in what the premier league ha become a twotier competition in which every week six elite team demonstrate their superiority over what are in theory their peer but their pawn in practice the pace that liverpool manchester city and tottenham hotspur in third just six point off the lead have set this year ha been historiclast season city became the first ever side to pick up point in a season both guardiolas team and klopps side could reach that mark this year both win so remorselessly that what would qualify in ordinary circumstance a a perfectly acceptable even praiseworthy result say drawing away from home against a team pushing for a european place may instead be a knockout blowlogic seems to suggest that city is better placed to deal with those term than liverpool guardiolas team after all know what it take to get to point it ha proved it can win week after week for month at a time despite liverpool smart and expensive recruitment city playing resource remain deeper guardiola ha more option at his disposal for the long slog of springmore important perhaps city is not encumbered with the weight of history it is not trying to win a championship for the first time in year trying to lift a curse to escape the ghost that liverpool is trying to escape a the denouement come closer liverpool desperation will mount mistake will creep in and point will slip away city the champion three time this decade ha no such reason to worryit is not though quite so simple a that the next few month are a much a test of city nerve a liverpool no team came close to keeping pace with guardiolas team last year it sauntered to the title setting itself the vaguely artificial target of getting a century of

he had been saying for month that he ha the utmost confidence that beckhams group will produce a team that is a worthy successor to recent ml startup in atlanta and los angelesbut just over a year before inter miami is set to take the field for the first time it road is not without obstacle battle in the courtroom and with powerful resident of south florida have blocked it progress more than once the team is working on it fifth potential stadium site with no assurance that this one will be the last and is facing multiple lawsuit seeking to block the club right to acquire the propertyeven

siegewe felt a change wa appropriate once we saw the crest said max ramos a founding member of the southern legion a group of heron is called a siege it felt rightthose who felt otherwise split off and kept the original name ramos insisted there were no hard feeling the amicable split he said is a sign of the camaraderie that ha helped fan remain steadfast in their dedication to beckhams grand

take his family to match when the team begin play florida international university could serve a a temporary home while the legal fight continue but not he said at any costi wa immediately suspicious of how the deal wa being conducted behind closeddoor negotiation and in a frantic rush winker added calling it just a terrible way to introduce a new sport team to miamistill in november it appeared that beckham his ownership group and ml had finally cleared the last hurdle amid song drumbeat and free paella on election day beckham and his new partner including jose and jorge ma the miamibased

landowner in south florida also took aim at the referendum matheson had previously filed suit to block a stadium planned for the overtown neighborhood of miami near where he owns propertyeach plan seems more convoluted than the last matheson said this monthvictoria mendez the city lawyer told the miami herald last month that the action filed by winker and matheson did not depict a clear

won it first ml cup on dec and because of major league soccer roster rule had to spend the next day releasing some of the player who led it to the title in fact from almost the moment the final whistle blew in atlanta uniteds victory over the portland timber the club president darren eales ha had to grapple with a host of change including finding a new coach selling one of his team best player and juggling the remaking of a starstudded rosterat time the offseason ha seemed comically short atlanta united reconvened a a team and opened it preseason training camp in midjanuary then flew to california before the super bowl to prepare for a preseason friendly against club tijuana last week atlanta united lost to costa ricas herediano in the first stage of the concacaf champion league the team meet again in atlanta on thursday night and on sunday it open it ml season against dc united in washingtonall of this meant eales had to get his offseason work done quickly and he ha not wasted any time on jan atlanta united introduced frank de boer the former manager of ajax inter milan and crystal palace a the replacement for atlanta former coach tata martino who took over mexico national team then eales signed josef martínez the league most valuable player last season to a fiveyear contract extension soon after pity martínez a yearold argentine midfielder wa signed that move allowed eales to sell atlanta playmaker miguel almirón to england newcastle united for a reported million smashing the ml transfer recordtwo day before the super bowl the hyperkinetic eales sat down at his favorite atlanta coffee shop appropriately named octane to discus the team dizzying offseason it sale of almirón and whether in fact other team in ml can copy the atlanta modelyou knew you were going to have a lot of hole to fill in the offseason what wa the processwhen we went out and built the club our intention wa to be clear with the fan from the very start we were going to attract player who were young or going toward the prime of their career rather than a last contract or a last hurrah for a player from europe the idea here is were part of this global network of soccer club miggy came to u he had two fantastic year won the ml cup in the second season had tremendous success on the pitch and then he got a chance to fulfill his dream to go to the premier league and play for a club there so obviously it wa good for him good for the league because now the league can say we have a mechanism for you to showcase yourself so come to ml play in a short window and when the right moment come you can move to a top league in europe that wa the dream we sold and we had to at least prove the concept because otherwise it wa going to be difficult for u to recruit other player if we didnt do thatthis business model is routine elsewhere but it still new to ml wasnt it hard to see almirón gomiggy delivered everything we could have expected and we won an ml cup on top of that we didnt spend dead money on a player at the end of his contract and get nothing in return we actually got well in excess of what we had spent on the player in the first place so it make good business sense good sporting sense and that wa always the visionyou signed josef martínez to a contract extension then acquired pity martínez before you sold almirón wa that sequencing deliberatewere really pleased that we did the whole succession plan in reverse we got our player in martínez before we moved the player on to europe almirón hypothetically if we first sold a player for million and went out to buy a player everyones going to quote u million it the nature of the beast so to secure our replacement in advance with a number we were comfortable with it gave u a little more carte blancheyou also had to replace tata martino whose reputation wa instrumental in attracting young player to atlanta for the first yearwhen we sat there after winning the cup we knew the coach wa going the reality is it no different than nick saban who ha said how he loses his coordinator every year but he doesnt mind because he know the replacement come in and work hard because they have a chance to move on we can embrace that a a club when coach want to come to atlanta they can see that a well frank de boer coached at ajax at inter and crystal palace for me im really excited because certain coach fit player with ajax he had great success he went into situation at inter and crystal palace that werent good fit but he wa the right fit for usa lot ha had to go right not just the success on the field but an owner with deep pocket a new stadium enthusiastic fan you have all of thateveryones been asking when soccer is going to succeed in america but if you watched the cup final with passionate fan who were tailgating all afternoon with an exciting style of play it really ha happened in america already it great for me because yes i wanted to make atlanta united a real success story but were also part of the bigger story which is growing the game of soccer in america being the pioneer to hopefully one day make it one of the top league in the worldcan other ml team replicate what youve doneim not sure about replicating but like every other business you look at what other business are doing successfully and try to take those thing that might work im a fan of how lafc came into the league you saw the way they filled out their roster there were similarity i wouldnt say they were copying u but there were similarity thats a good thing we were in a strange situation a pioneer trying to grow the league there will be more team looking when they think of their outofpocket expenditure money above the cap not just the salary there much more awareness around investing more than we would have in a transfer fee for a younger player because we might have a chance to make a profit or make our investment back thats going to open up an avenue for a few more clubswith all this activity did you get a chance to take any time off this wintermy aim is to get to march the international break i promised the wife and family ill take a week off and football wont be mentioned im hoping to get to

what seemed to be a significant victory on match bonusesin addition to seeing those bonus increase a much a sixfold for winning certain game the player no longer needed to win to collect extra pay for the first time they would also earn bonus even if they tied match against toptier opponentsthe compromise ceding some guaranteed compensation from salary in exchange for higher performance bonus helped break a deadlock in negotiation amid a broader fight over pay equity and working condition a battle that recently moved to federal court but the player also decided the arrangement wa a calculated risk worth taking playing for one of the world best team they view every game a winnable and with each victory set to be worth a much a per player the bonus brought the potential for ten of thousand of dollar in extra incomeyet two year after striking their deal the player are coping with the reality that winning isnt always entirely within their control experiment with roster selection starting lineup tactical formation and even substitution by coach jill elli all within her purview and part of the normal evaluation period between major championship have led to uneven performance and to frustration within a team that now ha large payouts on the line every time it take the fieldduring the two year since the new cba took effect in fact the team ha missed out on roughly million in performance bonus sometimes a much a for a single match for some player that is a much a each the analysis of bonus pay is based on figure contained in the team cba which ha not been released publiclywe have a very bonusheavy structure purposefully we win a lot of game and expect that well win a lot of game forward megan rapinoe said that is part of the balance understanding that we have a lot of money tied to win and especially win against top teamsthe payment which for the first time are based on the quality of a given opponent are worth a maximum of per player for a win against the four topranked team in the world plus canada and up to for a draw against a tier of opponent ranked no through win are worth and draw if the american beat a team in the lowest bonus tier like sunday thrashing of belgium each player on the roster earns a bonus of lose though for any reason and the player on u soccer contract get no bonus at allasked about how experimentation may cost the team shortterm result and thus bonus elli said her priority ha been looking long term and leaving no stone unturned before the world cupyou want to win elli said but id rather get every box checkedit is also worth noting that the team isnt losing more than it ha historically from the end of to the start of the united state even went on a game unbeaten streak but with each result now carrying a higher price tag for each player the unpredictability created by abrupt experiment by elli ha been unsettling to some in the locker roomelliss experiment have varied including using threeback system that featured a midfielder allie long a a center back or others that pushed wing mallory pugh into a central midfield role for the first time against several of the world top team once elli asked crystal dunn to play three position in a single matchwhen there wa a reprieve from such test during the team world cup qualifying tournament last year elli kept her approach simple a the united state bulldozed through the event the player noticedyouve seen a lot more consistency in the lineup and within the roster so were seeing more consistency on the field and on the score sheet alex morgan said at the timebut once the american clinched their spot in france the tinkering resumed and it ha continued even a the world cup nearssometimes it ok to sacrifice result in term of performance to get the best out of the team and figure out what that is rapinoe said last week but were probably past that point or we should bethe player were aware of the potential downside of their new cba even before they ratified it two year ago a month before the player approved the deal which retroactively covered all result in early they had been trounced at a new tournament the shebelieves cup while struggling to adapt to a new tactical systemthe team lost the shebelieves cup again this year when continued tinkering by elli resulted in draw against japan and england because the tournament also offer a bonus per player for a firstplace finish another carrot in the new cba the team missed out on a total of nearly in combined bonus over a single twoweek periodthe paycheck wa a little light last month thats for sure rapinoe joked last week unfortunatelythose paycheck though represent the optimistic stance the team took in it cba negotiation in with u soccer unwilling to increase guaranteed salary the team sought other way to increase it compensation and maximize the upside of future success unlike their men counterpart however the woman player do not have large club salary to fall back on if they get injured fall out of favor or in a worstcase scenario miss out on the biggest bonus by failing to qualify for the world cupthat made the woman new cba a stark departure for a team that had prioritized the stability of guaranteed pay but it also mean that a single poor performance now sting far more than it used to even if it help elli collect valuable insightultimately though the prize that matter most to the player is winning the world cup if they successfully defend their world title this summer all the dropped result and experimenting will have been worth itif we just breeze through and beat every team or were not going to learn anything defender becky sauerbrunn said it good to get player who dont have a lot of experience playing time it good to play

advertisementsupported byby andrew kehleipzig germany upon moving to germany from the united state last summer jesse marsch his wife kim and their three child made a pact of sort regarding their new life abroad when a situation that felt foreign made them want to turn inward they would challenge themselves to do the opposite to turn outward and embrace it to accept and understand itsuch discomfort ha been precisely the point for marsch the very reason he diverged from an ascendant coaching path in the united state last summer and sought out the unknown across the atlantic oceanin july marsch left his job a coach of the new york red bull in major league soccer to accept a post a an assistant coach for rb leipzig in the bundesliga while unquestionably a step up in competition it wa in some respect still an unconventional move and marsch said even some of his friend in soccer asked him if taking a job a an assistant might be a step backwardbut what represents a step backward and what is the convention when you are navigating a mostly uncharted path because while opportunity for american player in europe continue to expand there is not yet much of a road map for what marsch want to be an american coach who build a long successful career in one of the continent top leaguesand so he ha chosen to seek out that challenge to take chance and to face the unknown and the unfamiliar head onive gotten more comfortable he said with being uncomfortableafter decade of battling stereotype and preconceived idea about their ability american player have slowly found a level of acceptance in european soccer one of the player marsch brought into the red bull first team for example wa viewed even here a a solid addition when he joined rb leipzig this month that player the yearold tyler adam and other american prospect now head to the continent in wave and in general the professional pathway there have become well worn and widely availablea similar process ha yet to unfold for american coach however there are no set pathway and there are few pioneersmarsch regard one of them bob bradley a the biggest mentor in his career and he ha found bradley experience instructive from to bradley held head coaching job for club in norway france and england looking back his stint abroad wa a notable for the milestone he set for american coach he wa the first american to coach a team in england premier league a it wa for the relentless stream of misgiving from fan and pundit in whatever new locale he landed bradley premier league tenure lasted all of gamesthe perception of bob i think when he wa here is that he probably wasnt a knowledgeable because he from america that his accent and the way he talked about football may have brought question up within fan base about how do american think about football how do they talk about football even use the word football marsch said all those thing are unfair but theyre reality we have to deal withthat is what marsch know he is up against now and it is the reason he say he ha tried to take a holistic approach to this new chapter of his lifeunder rb leipzig manager ralf rangnick marsch ha assumed what he described a a fluid allencompassing role at the same time he is responsible for a weekly set of task running different element of training game analysis and opponent preparation whose strict implementation he ha found exhilarating in a way only a knowledgehungry coach canwhile rb leipzig and new york red bull are both technically part of the same corporate sport empire his first month experiencing the nuance of german soccer culture the structure the specificity the attention to detail reiterated for him how much he still can learnit would have been easy for me to stay in new york marsch said about his last job in major league soccer where he spent three and a half season and compiled the most win in franchise history but in the end that wasnt really what i wa interested ininstead marsch who had begun the process of obtaining his uefa pro coaching license in accepted an offer to join the leipzig coaching staff and left the red bull in midseason rangnick an experienced coach and former red bull sporting director is in his second stint leading leipzig but plan to coach only for this season the club ha previously announced that hoffenheims julian nagelsmann a rising star in german coaching will take over this summeri know the league the team and i speak the language rangnick said when he returned to the bench that isnt the case yet for jesse marsch so thats why he will be working a an assistant coach still the club noted specifically when it hired marsch that he had signed a twoyear contract with the expectation that he would continue in the role once nagelsmann arrivesuntil then marsch ha been stockpiling professional experience like a backpacker collecting souvenir that mindset wa one reason he wa not interested in pursuing the united state national team coaching job which still sat vacant when he left for europe marsch want to hold the position one day he said but only after he ha accumulated more experiencenow he said it better that

mother always made sure he and his sister had what they neededhe know well enough where he came from he could see wembley stadium from his garden but there were plenty of other place where the horizon wa far more oppressive the last time he went back he said in an interview last week he looked at those street not far from where he had grown up those highrises and saw a prison with no way outhis meteoric rise to being one of the finest english player of his generation should then be a cause for celebration for england at liverpool beat back competition from arsenal and manchester united to sign sterling from queen park ranger by the time he wa he had made his debut for england before he wa he had been selected for a world cupin manchester city made him for a time the most expensive english player in history paying million pound or about million to pry him from anfield at the express recommendation of pep guardiola guardiola would not arrive in england to become city manager for another year but he knew that he wanted to work with sterlingthe collaboration ha proved enormously successful sterling ha won a premier league title with another in his grasp this season and he played a key role in england run to the world cup semifinal last summer city rewarded him with a new contract a few month ago at least partly to ward off interest from real madrid he ha more than lived up to his promise guardiola described him a incrediblefew though would suggest england ha cherished sterling a frosty reception at anfield may be unavoidable since his departure but he attracts opprobrium elsewhere too he ha been jeered by his own fan while playing for england and wa attacked and racially abused by a manchester united supporter on the doorstep of city training facility one newspaper after england elimination from euro by iceland called sterling a footie idiot it wa not an epithet attached to any other player on that squadsterling ha no doubt why such hostility ha taken rootfrom the very start of my career there ha been a perception of a flashy kid from london love car love the flashy lifestyle he said im not saying im a saint or anything but that is the complete opposite of who i amthese people do not know me they will define me by what they read about me that is how they will treat me when people are making the public believe you are a character you arent that is hurtful and it is degradingnor ha he any doubt why that picture ha been built up the way he is covered the way he is presented by the news medium is rooted in the fact that he is black one million percent he saidit is that conviction that led him to take the risk and to speak up to become part of the global conversation led by the like of colin kaepernick and lebron james about equality the example that stick with sterling is the one about his car in a handful of britain tabloid ran article that claimed he wa looking for a seventh car so that he ha one for each day of the week none of them quoted sterling on that particular ambition each ran a set of picture of the forward behind the wheel of various vehiclesthese were car that i had had between the age of and he said but they made it that raheem ha one for monday one for tuesday and so on all these car are gone sold but what do you do when you sell a car you buy a new one but they have a picture of me in each car so the story is that i drive a car each day people see that and think thats what he up to buying car living the best lifefor the record sterling said he currently ha one car and his partner paige milian ha another he is he said in the process of selling mine to get a more subtle oneit is not just the car though sterling ha made headline for variously flying on a budget airline eating at greggs a british sandwich chain and shopping at poundland a discount shopwhenever one of these article emerges his friend send him a link accompanied by a host of laughing emojis on their group chat sometimes sterling laugh too there is a lot more going on in this world than me going to greggs he saidthe endlessness of it though wear him down what is the need for it he said what is the need for this story sometimes you ask what the motive ismore pernicious than the content of the article in his mind is the way they are framed the little aside the giddy superfluous mention of his weekly wage and in particular the dogwhistle word the hint that this young successful highprofile black footballer is not spending the money he ha earned correctly or that he ha not earned it at allit is not just me he said whenever you see a report on a black player or a black entertainer it ha to end up with money or bling or car or something flashy with a successful white person it is nice short sweet what a lovable person name me one white player who is thought of a blingycristiano ronaldos name is offered if he is showing you his car showing he is on top of the world if that is what he put out then call him flashy but im not showing you that so why are you calling me thatit is a stereotype of black people chain and jewelry bling and money these are word that are associated with black people if i wa showing car on my driveway if i wa on instagram biting my gold chain or with two rolexes on you can call me flashy but you cant label me a that if i am not portraying thatthat wa the trend sterling identified in the instagram post he composed in the car the day after the racist incident at stamford bridge the steady drip of story and detail that paint a distorted and stereotypical picture of black player where a white player phil foden buying his family a house is portrayed a sensible and covered without embellishment a report about a black player tosin adarabioyo doing the same is laced with hint of unearned excesssterling noted too that when he flew on a budget airline he wa not described a humble or praised for his pragmatism and parsimony it wa you have got all this money why are you on easyjet it is a subject that sterling ha thought a lot about he ha discussed it at length with aidy ward his agent and favored sounding board and with his captain at city vincent kompanyvinnie made a really good point sterling said he said it not the fault of the people writing the story it is because there are not enough black and minority ethnic people in high office in the mediaif there wa someone else of jamaican descent who the people writing the story have to answer to they would look at it and say it cant run because of how it will look they would understand this side of the story they have lived on this side of the world they understand how these people feelfor someone who ha never felt certain thing you cant make that change i am not saying the paper are doing it on purpose they might not know they are doing it in a racist way i would say it is more just not thinking thats why i said in that post that people need to be careful of what is written how they write the little wordsthe people that read it take it in and judge straightaway who the person is that is where i wa coming from i wa not saying they are racist but they are fueling it for the people reading it it is constant and i dont think it is fair but who am iit is an apposite question the answer to which changed fundamentally that day in december footballer and father are the first two that come to sterling mind but it is the broader scope of who he is and who he can be that most engages himhe take inspiration from jayz someone who made money and then looked for the next generation put everything in place to find someone to follow him he continued if i dont do it if the one after me doesnt do it it will just keep going when football is finished will i live off what i did on the field no i want to be able to help people be the best they can bewhat he ha realized though is that for him for anyone to have any effect the playing field ha to be level black success should not come with a caveat or an asterisk that is what made him write that post it is what made him speak up i just wanted people to pause and think he said he wanted to challenge the news medium to do better just a he did he wanted those who

follows repeated failure by infantino to force the proposal through fifas governing council but if they are approved they would represent the biggest change to soccer in a generation and their adoption and the multibilliondollar cash infusion to fifa would provide infantino with a signature success ahead of his bid to secure a second term a fifa president later this yeareach of the meeting

representative are handed electronic tablet and asked to select their preferred option for the new tournamentsinfantinos problem is that european official attending the meeting have stubbornly refused to offer any opinion instead they have told infantino and his team that the feeling of aleksander ceferin the president of the european governing body uefa and his governing council represent their viewssome of the european balked because the list of option for the club world cup did not include the option of not holding the tournament which is often an annoyance for the european champion who

infantino pressed the council to let him close the deal on his owneuropean leader at the meeting balked and ceferin and infantino have not held a meeting since the colombia summit in october european official threatened to walk out of the last meeting when infantino suggested he planned to call another votethe vote did not take place instead fifa set up a task force involving representative from the six confederation and asked it to produce an acceptable plan before a scheduled fifa council meeting in march in miamiat the last summit in morocco infantino expressed frustration to the official who declined to take part in the vote for his plan according to multiple people present at the meetingas part of this discussion people are asked to give their feedback on a series of proposal and a

leaguesthe proposal to expand the club world cup and to create a new global nation league similar to the recently created uefa version largely have the backing of official from south america africa

representative of europe domestic league will meet in lisbon this week to discus a strategy to protect what they say is decade of tradition and a basic sense of fairnesswhat the league fear several official said is what they consider a behindthescenes campaign to reshape european soccer for the exclusive benefit of the continent biggest club the league contend the proposed change to the champion league which include new barrier to entry for nonelite club and schedule change that would push match onto weekend date will diminish the relevance and marketability of domestic league and potentially render many of their match irrelevantat this week lisbon meeting an annual gathering of the umbrella european league group member will discus plan to fight back perhaps even in court against suggested change that they argue will adversely affect the competition that still form the cultural and financial backbone of the global soccer industry the coalition of league is a diverse group league from portugal to ukraine are member but a potentially formidable one given the influence and resource of member like england premier league germany bundesliga and spain la ligathe association of european league is raising it voice and the league are cohesive more than ever in the defense and protection of domestic football said alberto colombo the deputy general secretary of the european league body in an interviewwhile representative of the continent richest and most powerful club and european soccer governing body uefa say any discussion for reforming club competition like the champion league remain in their infancy league official have grown increasingly concerned about detail of the proposed change that have started to leakthe most dramatic include reducing the size of national league and altering their schedule to allow european game to be played on weekend a window historically reserved for domestic match the bundesligas chief executive called weekend champion league match a red line that could not be crossed english official similarly declared the idea a nonstarterit is the role of the premier league and other english football organization to govern the format of league and cup competition in this country the premier league spokesman nick noble said it would be wholly inappropriate for european football body to create plan that would alter the structure of domestic english footballother proposal would see access to the champion league itself severely restricted with only of participant allowed to earn their place through success in domestic competition the previous season the other place would be reserved for team already in the champion league or a handful of participant from a secondtier european club competitionandrea agnelli the president of juventus who lead the powerful european club association said at that group annual meeting in amsterdam last week that it would be at least a year before any change would be finalized and he refused to discus detail of proposal already under discussion however in an interview with the guardian last year he described reform he would like to see that appear to be similar to those currently under discussionwhile the eca represents more than club from across europe it is increasingly dominated by a handful of the largest team that group includes the like of juventus and bayern munich but also heavyweight from spain and england like barcelona real madrid and manchester united those club have for year used their might and threat to break away and form an exclusive competition outside the current domestic league structure to wrest concession from soccer leadersjavier tebas the frequently outspoken head of spain top league said the proposal to restructure continental competition for the benefit of the small group of rich club that already dominate them would spell doom for soccer in large part of europe the change would tebas said allow the wealthiest club to widen the massive talent and resource gap they already enjoy and tear away the fabric of the sport traditionsplaying european competition match on the weekend in particular would be a recipe for the demise of football across europe tebas said in a statement the bundesligas chief executive christian seifert concurred in a speech earlier this yearthe weekend must belong to the national league seifert said they are the heart and soul of professional footballaccess to the champion league is currently linked to performance in domestic league but under one set of proposal that could change drastically with most participating team allowed to compete year after year regardless of their league position in one plan europe top team would be divided into four group of eight team with the top four each season advancing to a knockout round to determine the winnersuch a change would dramatically reduce the attractiveness of national league for broadcaster where the battle to qualify for european club competition ha long been part of the narrative sold to television company at time in fact the battle for champion league position ha often been more compelling than the race for the title which in some country is often wrapped up month before the end of the campaignagnelli hinted that in the future qualification could be based on success within european competition a setup that would maximize place for team already in and serve a a significant barrier to club trying to break init is certainly something that is logical he said when asked if team could be promoted or relegated within a closed european system the proposal could transform soccer top club competition into one that resembles a similar event in european basketball where of the team in the euroleague are guaranteed spot regardless of their domestic performancesfor the biggest club a closedoff champion league would offer financial certainty but the league are vowing to defend a structure that currently allows any team the opportunity to win on the field a place among the giantsthe league defend the basic value of the european sport model based on sporting merit an openaccess pyramid structure where all club form the foundation and all club could live the dream to reach the top said colombo of the european league bodywhile the top club have forged close link to uefa thanks to a deepening friendship between agnelli the eca leader and uefas president aleksander ceferin the league faced with a critical leadership void at a vital moment have struggled to present a cohesive opposing voice the premier league for example remains without a leader after stumbling in it search for a replacement for it longtime chief executive richard scudamore who retired last year and larschrister olsson the chairman of the european league body ha only

inequality between team is narrowing that gap in the past the biggest team could get a much a time more than others that ratio is down to about though the change is generally considered to be a positive one it disproportionately affect athletic because far smaller team can now trawl the world for talent they could not afford before boosting their squad while athletic remains committed to it

memorabilia like the club it is a throwbackthere are small if understated marker like the modernist painting hanging on a wall inside a ground floor reception room it depicts a great flood that ha overwhelmed an entire city the only visible structure is an arch resembling one from athletics former stadium that wa delicately moved to it training ground it is a symbol club official say that the team past will always be a part of it present and future whether it risk relegation or fight for titleswe know the challenge it a solitary challenge urrutia said this is a voyage full of difficulty

the combined international engagement on my case is what gave me my freedom back i am home now with my wife and for that we deeply thank all who played a role in my safe returnwhat kept me going during these dark day knowing that the whole world wa witnessing the injustice million of people saw me barefoot and shackled at a hearing in bangkok not because i had committed any crime i had not but because i believe thailand ruling family happened to be tightening it relation with the khalifas the family that rule bahrain where i wa born and which i had represented on it national soccer team the shackle were humiliating i am not a criminal though i had been tried in absentia on what are widely accepted to be madeup charge including the nonsensical accusation that i participated in burning a police station at a time i wa playing soccer in a televised match and wa sentenced to year in prison i strongly believe my only crime wa upsetting the bahraini royal family by drawing attention to the failure of sheikh salman bin ibrahim alkhalifa the president of the asian football confederation to protect athlete and his alleged involvement in their arrest and torture after prodemocracy demonstration in the country in i escaped bahrain in after learning of the charge against me and took up residence in australia where i wa granted refugee status in feeling safer i often forgot there were still unfair charge against me and my wife and i planned our honeymooni arrived in thailand only to find myself rapidly separated from my wife and confined to a detention center many people believe that my return to australia wa a glorious victory but to me it is only a half victory i am safe and reunited with my wife but i am also reminded that my dream of eventually going back to bahrain will not be a reality any time soonbahrain ha only a jail cell to offer me while australia is now my home and it government and people have stood by mewhile in prison i had a long time to consider how i got there i have no doubt my imprisonment in thailand wa a punishment for my criticism of sheikh salman a member of the bahraini royal family during his campaign to be elected president of fifa the international soccer organization my highlighting of his alleged violation of human right in likely contributed to his failure to win the electioni am a free man now but what about the more than bahraini athlete and sport official who were arrested and in some case tortured in some remain in prison to this day no credible investigation into these abuse were carried outthere is a dark side to sport in bahrain the kingdom us wealth and sport to whitewash it legacy of abuse and silence those who try to draw attention to this patternthe activist najah ahmed yousif wa tortured sexually abused and imprisoned in for daring to criticize the bahrain grand prix auto race and the journalist ahmed ismail hassan wa shot and killed while attempting to cover protest surrounding the race in salah abbas habib musa a protest leader wa shot by the police during the weekend of the race and nobody wa held accountable for his death next month formula one racing is scheduled in bahrain

for human right no matter what a are many brave bahraini dont be mistaken a i wa when i went on my honeymoon to thailand i may be free now but i and many other peaceful critic remain a target for bahrain relative of my friend sayed ahmed are imprisoned in bahrain for his speaking out against the regime from his home in london this week bahrain court upheld it threeyear sentence in what the united nation considers an unlawful act of reprisal through family connection bahrain ha been emboldened thanks to president trump who ha made it clear to bahrain that there wont be strain with this administration the united state wa in a powerful position to help end my ordeal but instead it chose to stay silent indeed secretary of state michael pompeo traveled to bahrain and praised the strategic partnership between the two country but made no mention of my case not only did he not mention my situation while i wa still detained in thailand he failed to raise the issue of human right at all the united state had the mean to use it leverage since bahrain is a close ally and host of the fifth fleet but it failed to take a stance britain similarly and shamefully avoided offering support for my situationif bahrain ha learned anything from seeking to extradite me it is that the government can arrest torture and repress it people and country like the united state and britain will continue to look the other way my case underscore bahrain enormous power to flout international standard like lodging an illegitimate red notice with interpol to stop a refugee while he travel it also show bahrain that the united state and britain consider their own interest more important than the life of individual bahraini these country are abandoning human right at a time when thing are worsening in bahrain and will only continue to deterioratei am so fortunate to have been able to return to australia and continue my life but many other bahraini are not a lucky if they received the

longserving left back ha performed the ritual time over the last decade building up an unparalleled expertise in the field he ha pored over countless clip he wa hoping to find something anything that would give him a little advance warning a bit of a head starti tried to find a pattern he said thus far though he ha drawn a blank even after all these year even after all those hour of study even after all those game the defender who know arjen robben better than anyone else still can not work out when exactly he is going to cut insidefrom the outside it can seem that there are few more predictable player in world soccer than robben he ha performed his calling card so often since he first joined bayern munich year ago that it now bear his name not just in germany but also in france where the act of cutting in from the right wing to shoot with the left foot is known a le robben the player acknowledged last month that he wa proud to have his own movewhat is most remarkable though is that his goto maneuver ha lost none of it power the only surprise now is that he appears to retain his capacity to surpriserobben is after all deep into what will be his final season in munich he may make his final appearance in the champion league for the club this week should bayern prove unable to get past liverpool in a delicately poised last tie on wednesday at munich allianz arenahis time in germany ha been impressively successful he ha won six straight bundesliga title and a slew of domestic cup and he scored the winning goal in the champion league final but it ha also been admirably long robben is it is year since josé mourinho first signed him for chelsea since he joined real madrid he remains though an integral part of one of soccer great power a winger of genuine menace silken touch and searing speed if lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo are this era leading men then robben is among the most prominent member of the supporting cast instantly recognizable a fixture on the game most exalted stage his signature move a regular feature of the latter round of the champion leagueit is so familiar that it barely need description robben sprint up the right wing one arm outstretched for balance head pulled back leg whirring then a he approach the penalty area he feint to his right and drop his shoulder only to shift his weight and slip off to the left the ball never leaf his control his opponent is left grasping at shadowsrobben glance up and curl a shot across the goalkeeper it doe not always go in of course but it doe so frequently enough that schmelzer is not the only one to have spent considerable time trying to work out how to stop ithere though come the puzzle robben ha been cutting left for year his intent is apparent to all defender know exactly what is in his mind precisely what is coming and yet remain powerless to stop itto robben two factor explain his continued success timing he said in an interview with a handful of british newspaper last month is one key if you do it at the right time it still surprise them variation he ha previously suggested is equally important doing the same thing over and over again without variation will not work he said if you never pas or dribble or go on the outside cutting inside will stop workingto schmelzer who ha had to deal with robben in direct facetoface competition more than any other opponent there is something else however he ha noticed that robben ha leaned more heavily on his favored move in recent year using the wing a a decoy to open the path to the center it still work though because he recognizes it when you block his path and then he reacts accordingly that is what make him specialit is that ability to improvise that ricardo rodriguez identified too rodriguez a swiss defender now with ac milan know robben almost a well a schmelzer according to gracenote sport he ha faced him time during his career in his time with wolfsburg and fc zurichhe is very fast especially with the ball rodriguez said that make it very difficult to stop him he is terribly fast when he cut inside the only way to try to stop him is to stay very close to him if you dont he can hurt you any timethere is a reason for that in a cognitive scientist named shanti ganesh based at radboud university in the netherlands conducted a study into robbens movement she determined that robben move a little faster than conscious knowledge a defender brain ganesh said unconsciously follows robbens feint even if it know deep down that they are only feint in the time it take to rectify the error robben a he wa always going to a everyone involved knew he wa going to ha cut inside and taken a shot the player can still correct himself ganesh said but that will always be a fraction too late it is a theory that chime with the empirical study conducted by wendell a brazilian left back at bayer leverkusen he ha faced robben time since moving to germany behind only schmelzer and rodrigueznormally it is the same move but it is also the move we are tired of seeing running after and not getting the ball he said there must be something he doe maybe he wait for the last moment i dont know most of the time i try to wait for his move so i have a bigger chance of getting the ball back if i dont take my time i have no chance hell dribble past melike schmelzer wendell ha spent more time than he might like watching clip of robben like schmelzer he remembers training session in the day leading up to game against bayern in which the team worked on how to defend him his danger is such that it can only be dealt with collectively dortmund always had the same approach you need your teammate to back you up schmelzer said we have to be honest it is simply not possible to take him out of the match for the full minute jürgen klopp always taught u that the problem is not losing a duel but not covering itwhen schmelzer decided to go in for a tackle he relied on his central defender mat hummels and his defensive midfielder sven bender to scurry across in support it wa not always enough robben too wa not acting alone he could always call on the threat of philipp lahm or later joshua kimmich streaking up the right wing to collect the ball on the overlap schmelzer had to be conscious of that tooworking out when to use the cut inside and when it wa merely a decoy wa always the challenge even after all these year his opponent can not tell when the move is coming they have seen it before and yet somehow every time feel like the first time they can study the tape they can stay close they can call for backupif none of that work wendell said there is one last resort i try to get the ball back he said if i dont then i have to commit a foul it is when that fails a it so often ha when he skip away too quickly when he disappears in a flash that arjen robben doe what he ha been doing for year doe what he always doe and cut insidean earlier version of this article

had given the ball away so carelessly and so the manchester city manager hurled himself to the ground curled over in his cableknit sweater and beat the turf with his fistsby the time he had picked himself up the danger had passed but that wa not the point guardiola seek perfection there are time when he take anything le a a personal slight he frantically waved to the culprit ilkay gündogan to grab his attention in the tumult of the tottenham hotspur stadium on tuesday he had to resort to mimetwo hand palm flat raised what exactly wa thattwo finger pointed to the temple thinkwatching guardiola on the touchline is exhausting few manager seem to become so absorbed in a game so consumed by it he move constantly restlessly pacing and jittering and signaling bellowing instruction and calling player over for brief conclave and turning on his heel to consult with his benchafter a while once the movement are decoded it is almost possible to tell how manchester city is playing simply by watching guardiola a cross between a telegraph service and an interpretive dance troupeeven at the best of time which given city success is most of the time he seems frazzled but when thing are not going well when his lofty standard are not being met everything speed up more player are beckoned over more impromptu huddle are held more ground is covered his stress is almost palpabletuesday night wa one of those time manchester city wa not even losing when gündogan drew his ire it would be another few minute before son heungmin delivered the goal that gave tottenham a advantage heading into next week second leg of this champion league quarterfinal at the time indeed city wa ascendant slowly asserting itself drawing the sting from spur quelling the noise from the crowd starting to create chancesand yet even then this wa not the imperious city that ha won of it last game including straight it wa not the finetuned team that is on course to win point in the premier league after hitting an unprecedented last year or the one that had been hailed by mauricio pochettino the spur coach a arguably the best team in europethe mood had been set in the first few second a tottenhams harry kane charged down nicolás otamendi blocking his attempted clearance sending the ball arcing into the sky inciting the or so packed into spur boxfresh new home from that point on city did not have a moment to settle to find it rhythm to start weaving it hypnotizing patternsstill guardiolas team might have led such is city quality that it doe not need to play at it best or even especially well to create chance had sergio agüero converted an early penalty awarded for a handball by danny rose that none of the player fan coach or official in the stadium seemed to spot rose did admittedly look a little sheepishthe video assistant referee had seen it though bjorn kuiper his counterpart on the turf duly checked and pointed to the spot for reason that would not have been clear to anyone not watching on a televisionperhaps the sight of hugo lloris diving to his left and palming agüeros shot away wa what strained guardiolas nerve perhaps at that point a sense of foreboding descended upon himthere is a curiosity in guardiolas gilded record a a coach he is of course the most successful manager of his generation he ha won title in spain germany and england he ha won the champion league twice he ha more than once changed the soccer culture of not just a club but a country he ha improved dozen of player many who might have reasonably expected that they could not be improved he is in way out of beyond reproachhe struggle though when it come to traveling away from home for champion league knockout game over the course of his career the decade or so in which he ha become the gold standard for coaching he ha played such fixture he ha won just six of them this defeat whether city can turn it around in manchester next week or not mean he ha now drawn and lost given the resource guardiola ha had at his disposal in that span the barcelona of messi xavi and andrés iniesta a bayern munich that dominated the bundesliga this manchester city team that is so untouchable in english domestic competition that record is unsatisfactoryincreasingly in these fixture he ha the air of a man not quite sure what to do someone who doe not in this one specific context trust his usual impeccable instinct at liverpool last year he chose to flood the midfield omitting raheem sterling in favor of the more conservative gündogan liverpool swept his team aside leaving city too much to do to recover at homehere too he tweaked the formula that had worked so well the rest of the year among a raft of change gündogan started again alongside fernandinho more unexpected still wa the presence of the combative fabian delph and the enigmatic riyad mahrez it wa not until the final two minute that kevin de bruyne and leroy sané his two most destructive option on the bench made an appearancethere were mitigating circumstance of course city ha a hectic april a premier league title to win and a squad to keep fresh but whatever the reason the outcome wa the same city stalled not by much but by enough once again on the road in europe or at least a much a britain is in europe these day guardiola tried to solve a problem that did not exist and caught himself outthe damage need not be fatal of course city will still believe it can overturn this deficit on home turf next week especially with kane now likely to be sidelined with an ankle injury for the rest of the season it will be tight though tense and nervous and strained the sort of night when what happens in the technical area will tell you what happens on the fieldadvertisement

it is an enormous amount of money even this recordbreaking contract doesnt necessarily bring trout into the highest tier of overall income for professional athleteswhile comparing contract across

bennerand singer begin to help the fbijennifer medinahe agrees to wear a wire he agrees to go back to the client that he worked with for year and tape in excruciating detail what he done he agrees to call all these people he worked with people he accepted bribe from and people he given bribe to some of these are parent some of these are coach some of these are associate people he paying off in one way or anotherkatie bennertheyre discussing extremely strange bizarre extraordinary measure that very very few people could imagine ever taking in order to get their kid into schooljennifer medinatheres sort of two different way that he operates the first is this athletic scheme where he amasses a number of coach at a number of different school more than a dozen school who agree to accept his bribe and say i want this person on my team all these coach get special slot for athlete they get admitted to university on a totally different track than anybody who not an athletemichael barbaroso these coach are communicating with the admission department at these college theyre almost getting like their own personal bucket of student athletesjennifer medinaabsolutely thats exactly the way it work you get to say this is who i want on my team and the admission office essentially agrees to go along with what you say so he paying off these coach in all these different collegesmichael barbaroand how do the coach pretend that someone is a legitimate athlete when theyre not and how do the parent play along with that a welljennifer medinaso he had a very elaborate scheme in lot of case one of his typical way of operating apparently wa to fake photo in one case he said i need a picture of an asian girl playing soccer and were going to photoshop the applicant face onto this photomichael barbarowowjennifer medinaalmost every case that we know about this person never played on the team they would drop out a soon a they arrived on campus in some case the kid didnt even know that they were expected to play on this team they created a profile saying that this kid ran track and he get to campus and is speaking to a college counselor and the counselor say oh so i see you run track and the kid say what are you talking about he didnt even knowmichael barbarook so thats one scam this kind of sport coaching method scam what wa the other scam that the fbi discoveredkatie bennerhe talked about how he arranged for student to take their sat or act exam at special site where he had bribed the proctor on those test to basically correct the student answer he talked about how he encouraged the parent to get their child tested for disability so that they could have more time to complete the exam he talked about how he would sometimes even have a man an adult pose a the student at the test center that he quote unquote controlled and that adult would take the test for the kid and this guy wa so good at it he could basically get any score that they wantedmichael barbarojenny and katie youve described an elaborate system of wealthy parent bribing their childrens way into college arent there le risky way for rich people to get their child into collegejennifer medinathe world of college admission for the extremely wealthy is really complicated so there are three way to get in first youve got the front door there test there grade there your extracurricular activity your achievement there also the issue of legacy if your parent went to this college youre trying to get to youll probably get some extra point if you play a sport you might get some extra point so you can be on their team thats the front door and then there the back doorkatie bennerthere are so many legal way that the ultrawealthy have been gaming the system for a long time to get their kid into school they donate tremendous amount of money they help people build building and work on development projectsjennifer medinaand this is also the world where you have incredibly highend tutoring this is not just spending a couple hour learning how to navigate an sat this is hundred of thousand of dollar many time over year to come up with all sort of elaborate way to brand yourself essentially into something that you think will get you into the right college whatever you consider the right college to be so then there this third door what singer referred to a a side door which is essentially just bribingkatie bennercheatingjennifer medinacutting out the middleman or cutting out the pretense of anything other than paying people off and bribery and i think the reason why this case is so fascinating and were sitting here talking about it and everybody is so interested in it is the difference between these two door the side door and the back door now if youre the fbi that line is very clear it clear that it is completely illegal to simply bribe somebody to get your kid into the college of your choice but if youre one of these parent where youre operating in a world where you know many people are paying ten of thousand of dollar or hundred of thousand of dollar to university in an often successful attempt to get your kid into the college then maybe this doesnt seem so strangekatie bennercertainly we know it breaking the law and certainly you can tell from the recording that were transcribed by the prosecutor that the parent knew they were breaking the law but they also dont act like breaking the law is a completely big deal and they seem to operate in a parallel universe with different consequence for themjennifer medinathey knew that this crossed a line they did it anyway the why of why they did it anyway is actually really interesting and really complicated it not a though if these kid went to college their income potential wa going to grow enormouslymichael barbarobecause theyre already richjennifer medinatheyre already wealthy and study have shown that people who go to college and are already coming in with wealth do not necessarily see a huge jump in their income over a lifetime on the other hand thats not true for kid who come from poorer family there is a lot that show especially if you go to a highly selective college and if youre successful there lot of thing that show your income potential go way up it is a path to the middle class thats what weve always thought of college a being a path to the middle class but it not clear that if youre already part of the mostupper class that you need to go to some specific college to stay in that upper classmichael barbaroso why then why do these parent who can afford to participate in this kind of scam why do it if there no tangible benefit why take that riskjennifer medinai dont think it about economics that might be part of it or they might tell themselves that it part of it but it is obviously at least somewhat about status about maybe being able to put that sticker on the back of your car that say my student go to yale university maybe it that you want to give your kid some perfect social experience that you think theyre going to have at this right school or maybe you just want to save your kid embarrassment clearly these parent didnt have a lot of faith in their kid and whats also really fascinating here is that it not just ivy league school yale is of course the one that is sort of eyepopping and there stanford and there all sort of elite school there also ucla but there also school like wake forest university and university of texas at austin all school that they might have been just fine getting into on their own and are not school that we think of a holding a lot of cachet in these elite circle so what wa that about why were they so willing to spend so much money and so much effort and break the law to get into school we really dont know the answer to that yetkatie benneranother way to look at it from the point of view of the parent is that no matter what their motivation are whether they be social or whether they want an education for their child that they believe is the best education that money can buy they have this feeling that the kid face really long odds college ha never been more competitive i think that harvard accepted about percent of all of the student who applied last year and they understand that college are also looking for a wide array of student a well they dont want a class just packed with all of the people who can pay full tuition donate a million dollar to a development fund and continue to give for the rest of their life because theyre extremely wellheeled theyre looking for something more and they might worry that their student are not extraordinary enough to get in and so theyre going to use the money that they have to try to offset not a systemic inequity like socioeconomic inequity or racial inequity but to offset their childrens own inability to get injennifer medinaa lot of it seems to be about the certainty of it about the security it not a question of maybe you will or wont get into this school it im going to make sure that you have a spot at this specific school that you want to be at that i know i can get you into and i am going to be able to breathe a sigh of relief or celebrate or congratulate you much earlier with much more confidence than i would if i had gone through the front door or even if i had gone through the back doormichael barbaroand where do these privileged kid who were actually implicated in this scheme where do they fit into all of thisarchived recordingi dont know how much of school im going to attend but im going to go in and talk to my dean and everyone and hope that i can try and balance it all but i do want the experience of like game day partying i dont really care about schooljennifer medinaso the kid whose parent participated in this scheme are fascinating it is clear that some of them knew what wa going on but many of them didnt many of them are probably waking up this week stunned to learn the great length that their parent not only went through to cheat on their behalf but the great length they went to to hide it from themkatie bennerthe parent worked so hard to keep their child from knowing what wa going on and this creates a whole other layer of privilege that we see in education that we see in business that we see that these adult parent certainly had in spade this idea that if you do not know all of the wind at your back pushing you forward helping you along you will believe that you deserve everything that you gotjennifer medinatheyve been operating under the assumption that they earned their spot they deserve it and i think this is forcing u to have a conversation to think about what doe deserving it really mean what this ha done is really laid bare for all of u to see in plain view how unequal the system truly is that if you have enough money you can buy your way in but at the same time there are thousand of student who are taking out massive loan to come in and are desperate to get into higher education which our country ha long believed is the way to get into the middle and upper class it supposed to be this system based on your academic merit thats going to give you a path to get from wherever you started from to where you want to be but what weve seen is thats not true if you believe that education and that a college education specifically is the great equalizer or can be the great equalizer of our country what this show you is that that system is completely brokenkatie bennerits difficult to think of a scenario that speaks more clearly to the idea of inequityjennifer medinawhat this really show is that there all sort of way people have been using money and power and influence in this system for year that is completely legal and completely accepted and it perpetuated every single admission cyclemichael barbarojenny medina katie benner thank you both very muchjennifer medinathank youkatie bennerthank youmichael barbarosince

in europe since moretti wa born in bologna year agothe college game however ha been a decidedly foreign concept overseas though with the term march madness likely to elicit strange look even if correctly translatedwell there hardly been an ncaa championship with more of a global presence than this one with morettis texas tech red raider facing the virginia cavalier in the title game monday night eight player are from other countriesmoretti the sophomore starting guard for texas tech once played on an italian junior national team with virginia forward francesco badocchi who ha redshirted his first seasonwere the first italian guy who have ever made it to the final four moretti said so it kind of a bigtime thing right now back in italy for basketballaccording to data calculated by digital content producer hero sport of the player in this year ncaa tournament listed a home country other than the united state canada contributed the most followed by australia seventeen other country produced at least two player including seven from african nationsfor an american kid a shooting session in the driveway after dinner could naturally include a singing of one shining moment and an idyllic vision of cutting down the net at the national championship game not so much in other country where the presence of soccer and the significant time zone difference have long been more than enough to keep college basketball in the darkwhen the game are on it usually when were at school and stuff like that so we dont get to watch it because were doing other thing said kody stattmann another virginia redshirt and a native of australiastarting forward mamadi diakite whose buzzerbeating shot sent the cavalier to overtime in the elite eight where they outlasted purdue ha become a national hero in guinea in africa though his family and friend have to settle for watching replaysthe day after the game i get text about it diakite saidfor many of these international player then the desire to drape a gold silver or bronze medal around their neck can be a bigger goal than winning an ncaa title with their college team a exhilarating a that can beplaying in an olympics is something that everybody dream of said moretti who will try to make the italian national team for the fiba world cup this summermoretti played on junior team in european and world championship burnishing his credential a one of the top international prospect before choosing texas tech over indiana connecticut and utahbadocchi moved to the u earlier to further develop his game in high school in kansa his mother home state her work in the fashion industry brought her to milan where she met badocchis fathersince my family wa from kansa i knew about ku but i didnt really watch march madness or anything like that badocchi said even coming to virginia i knew it wa a very good school but i didnt really know anything about the acc or anythingthe acc is quite the challenge of course and the cavalier have recently cracked the conference elite with duke and north carolina under coach tony bennett perhaps one of the way theyll be able to stay there for the long term is with these international pipeline that have not only opened with new talent source but created stronger chemistry off the courtyou learn to appreciate and respect one another bennett saidalso playing for the cavalier is fifthyear senior center jack salt of new zealand another redshirt center francisco caffaro is from argentina freshman guard kihei clark is from california but ha a filipino mother diakite a fourthyear junior recalled having to use his smartphone to translate word in some of his earlier conversation with teammatesat first i think it very hard if i were from here to accept someone to take someone from somewhere else that doesnt speak my language id have to buy in a lot of time to talk to them diakite said but for them being able to take their time and talk to me so i could be on the same layer a them is tremendous everyone ha done such a good job of taking me in the circletexas tech will add two more international big men to the roster next season russel tchewa from cameroon and andrei savrasov of russia in addition to moretti there fifthyear senior guard brandone francis dominican republic and freshman forward josh mballa francewe try to be a family for these guy because they come here far away from home thats what i did for the other guy who did to me which wa such a great thing for me because i felt like i wasnt alone moretti saidyes it hard not to find a friend in west texaseverything is bigger everything is wider moretti said it just a different culture i like it it my home the people are so nice i live in the gym basically but when i step out of the gym the people are so nice___advertisement

the most valuable performer in some of the boldest new off broadway work she can seem almost omnipresent on new york stage you might assume a show got in the waynope at least not directlyi had jury duty m bernstine said the other afternoon in her dressing room at lincoln center theater and i had postponed it so many time because of play that i had to goso in january she wa fresh from her honeymoon when she went into rehearsal for jackie sibblies drurys fractured timejumping biographical epic mary seacole at lct she play the title role a formidable woman based on a historical figure the adventuring thcentury jamaican nurse mary seacole the plural in the title hint at universalityits a mammoth part with monologue that stretch on and on and m drury wrote it with her in mind but on about day two of rehearsal m bernstine looked at a calendar and panicked there wasnt going to be nearly enough timespoiler she figured it out splendidly ben brantley in a glittering review in the new york time deemed her fabulous commanding and delightfully intimidatingin that first week of rehearsal though she found herself in tear every evening walking the few block from the theater to cnn where her husband rick hall is a cameraman who cover breaking newsi would go and he would meet me in front of the building and i would cry she said i would wake up in the morning cry this ha never happened before i didnt know how i wa going to do thisthat reaction wa understandable said her director lileana blaincruz given that m bernstine had to deliver five page of monologue in one scene and seven in anotherthats enough to make anybodys head trip m blaincruz said even though she wa terrified that terror wa so beautifully privately contained she didnt allow it to contaminate the roomms bernstine call mary seacole the most challenging thing she ha ever worked on it pushed her she said almost to the brink of wanting to give upthe job that are i think in the end most worth it are the one that almost break you she continued with perfect calm that sound horrible doesnt it she said it wasnt meant a a questionwhats new onstage and off sign up for our theater update newsletterthis is the kind of career m bernstine ha built gravitating toward brainy work that challenge convention and stretch form play like anne washburns mr burn a postelectric play she played bart simpson heidi schrecks grand concourse and be wohls small mouth soundsshe won her obie in lynn nottages ruined and made her only broadway appearance so far in sarah ruhls in the next room or the vibrator play last season eager to work with the director phylicia rashad on a stephen adly guirgis revival she went unusually brassy in our lady of st streetboth m blaincruz and m drury pointed to m bernstines performance in guillermo calderóns neva at the public theater in a a touchstoneshe ha this incredible monologue m drury said where she talk until she basically fall off the stage into the darkness and i think about it all the timeby then m bernstine had already worked on we are proud to present a presentation m drurys copiously titled play from three year ago when mary seacole wa gearing up for it first workshop at ar nova m drury begged her to be in itif i can say without sounding weird and selfaggrandizing theyre both really complicated show m drury said she in both process ha helped me understand how the play function through the way that she is making sense of itin mary seacole that included helping m drury who tends toward selfdeprecation to sympathize with her own title character the real mary seacole wa so enamored of her own exploit that she wrote a memoir about them and the more m drury read about her the more put off she wa then m bernstine stepped inquincy wa able to enjoy that character enjoyment of herself and pride in herself in a way that i felt let in on m drury said suddenly she could see mary seacole a a badass and liked her for itthis is one suspect part of the reason m bernstine is in such high demand her single day off last week wa her first in day she got a facial then forced herself to laze around at home in bushwick when shes not doing theater there tv work lined up now in her third season a a recurring character on the starz series power she recently booked a recurring role on the code a new cbs show that ha yet to airwhats startling is how easily m bernstine might never have been an actor at all growing up in washington the daughter of lawyer she wasnt a drama club kid in her quest to be wellrounded in high school she did some winter oneacts at georgetown day school where a fellow student leigh silverman the lifespan of a fact directed her in a solo show but mainly she wa a big jock then playing soccer and lacrosseas an undergraduate at brown university she majored in public policy planning to be a lawyer then came the club soccer game when a ball smashed her in the face broke her glass and spun her life around shaken and injured she abandoned soccer to try something else playing grace in a production of august wilson the piano lessonthis time she wa smitten with acting though she still had law school in her sight then a professor lowry marshall urged her to audition for drama school accepted to the university of california san diego she changed her trajectory when she graduated in she headed straight for new yorkas she chatted in her dressing room at lincoln center m bernstine wa subdued polite and remarkably lacking in vanity she insisted firmly that she is not the star of mary seacole which she argued is purely an ensemble piece thats so her m drury said and when the question of m bernstines age arose often a delicate matter with actor she answered without hesitation saying that she wa the next day a publicist for the theater got in touch with a correction m bernstine will turn at the end of the month in the interview she had rounded uphearing about this both m drury and m blaincruz pealed with affectionate laughterms drury a it happens think of mary seacole a an ensemble piece too but one featuring what she called a sneaky audition to get quincy in a broadway production of mother courageby which she mean of course that m bernstine would have the starring rolesomeone should do that like right now m drury said i want to see it so badadvertisement

test for everyoneabdallah alayanit is this is kind of that struggle with identity in kind of a western context he went to the same high school a i did he wa really really effective at kind of you know blending in and being just like any other kiwi but also in saying that he he wa one to absolutely embrace his muslim identity and he kind of brought that around with him in a really effective way in the way that it relatable so i think obviously there a bit of a struggle to assimilation or the opposite but i think for me im not the most sporty person out there and it interesting because i mean everything i wa interested in wa haneen alayannot abdallah alayan not really what defined christchurch boy high like i did drama and debating and all these kind of more cultural thing that literally no one respected so one thing he kind of advised me wa that getting into sport really doe unlock door socially and absolutely in hindsight i can completely say that he wasnt wrong being into his sport just made him more accessible to people that he otherwise wouldnt be and we often kind of discussed our high school experience and ive always lived through kind of his mistake and his experience and

advertisementsupported byby bill penningtona dozen year ago the university of washington barred athletic coach from having contact with anyone in the admission departmentwith a move that now seems prescient two new administrator supervising athletics sought to allay any concern that coach could put undue pressure on admission personnel the change also brought more oversight to athletics in this case through a committee of senior faculty member dean and other university representativesthe previous arrangement said philip ballinger an associate vice provost now overseeing admission didnt have sufficient transparency it didnt have enough eye on itthe leeway coach get in recruiting ha long been a point of discussion in higher education circle but after federal investigator last week revealed a broad admission cheating scandal a number of college began asking hard question about how they evaluate athletic applicant and oversee the chosen few whom coach recommend for admissionin what prosecutor described a the biggest case of admission fraud they had investigated people were accused in a scheme that involved paying bribe to coach and to people who monitor admission test in order to fraudulently get the child of wealthy patron into some of the nation most elite collegessome student were accepted a recruited athlete even though they did not play the sport described in their application they gained an advantage through the widespread practice of allocating a certain number of admission spot to athlete who might not get in otherwisethis process ha been followed for decade in the pursuit of competitive team which burnish a university reputation inspire alumnus loyalty and often help with fundraisingnow the fraud case ha sent a thunderbolt through the higher education communityevery college president in america called his athletic director the morning after that admission fraud story broke and asked how do we make sure this doesnt happen at our school said bill martin the athletic director at the university of michigan from until his retirement in and certain athletic director were smart enough to call their president first to insist that they were going to start verifying the status of every admitted recruited athleteindeed at yale university where fbi investigator say the longtime woman soccer coach accepted hundred of thousand of dollar to facilitate the admission of a recruit who did not actually play soccer the university president peter salovey announced late last week that new oversight policy had already been put in place the yale athletic director will begin reviewing every proposed recruit credential before admission and recruited athlete who fail to make a team after they arrive will receive close scrutiny a university statement saida broad overhaul of athletic admission system in division i the highest level of ncaa competition and the level the college in the scheme compete in ha been overdue according to several athletic administrator interviewed in recent daysbattles over bluechip recruit in football and basketball already tend to be heavily scrutinized in those upper echelon sport if there is money changing hand it is from coach to recruit not the other way aroundbut in the lowerprofile sport like crew volleyball tennis and soccer often called the olympic sport there ha been more room for bribe and exploitation and the most common route in such a fraud is to designate a phony athletic prospect a a recruited walkon in nearly every case of counterfeit athletic credential cited in last week indictment from stanford to texas to yale the prospective athlete appeared to be filling the nebulous role of recruited walkonsuch applicant are not even assured a spot on the team but they are often on a list of five to athlete it varies from sport to sport that a coach is permitted to submit to the admission departmentthe two daughter of the actress lori loughlin who wa charged in connection with the fraud case last week were passed off a crew recruit despite never having competed in the sport according to federal prosecutorsthat choice of sport may not have been an accident in a sport like woman crew where roster can balloon to athlete many team have score of recruited walkons such large roster can help a college comply with federal equality law balancing out the number of male athlete in footballwhen the roster are that big like they are in woman crew i could see where it would be possible for a coach to slip in an unqualified person a a recruited walkon said martin who added that michigan annually audited team rostersthe recruitment of athlete in such sport may be an even bigger factor in the admission process at college in the ncaas lowest tier division iii where athletic scholarship are forbiddendivision iii is also the largest tier with nearly institution including many of the country most selective small liberal art college where acceptance rate can be a low a percent these college might field a many a team from enrollment a small a with varsity athlete many of them afforded an advantage in admission making up percent to percent of the student bodythese small college like the largest one also give preferential treatment to applicant who excel in music the art and a host of other skill there are also allowance for student from the leastpopulated statesadmissions is filling all the different bucket said wendy smith the athletic director at haverford college a highly rated institution near philadelphia and our athlete are right in there we are not in any way gaming the system they are absolutely on par academicallythe cost of fielding a successful sport team in the ultracompetitive college athletic landscape often lead to other troubling conflict of interestin the ivy league for example most coach are responsible for fundraising that bridge the gap between support from the college and the true price tag of competing successfully that can lead to uncomfortable decision about composing a team especially since athlete family often become the leading donorsyou have a family who will give you but then you are not going to play their daughter said paul wardlaw who wa the woman tennis coach at brown university for yearsthe whole scandal is interesting and it human nature to take the easy route he said but there are some systematic issue that are contributing to thisat many elite institution the notion that recruited athlete have been granted an unfair advantage is palpablecameron green a tight end on the football team at northwestern university which accepts about percent of applicant conceded that several of his high school classmate who did not play sport had applied to northwestern and been rejectedits easier for athlete to get in so i know thats hard for regular student said green a senior who doe not plan to play football in his final year of eligibility a lot of kid i knew were confused when i got in and they didnt but you know at the end of the day the school look at your demographic on a piece of paper and decides to admit you before they even meet youthe high percentage of recruited athlete at some college particularly smaller one ha other consequence some of them at odds with institutional ambition for a diverse student bodybecause success in youth sport today often come more easily to affluent family who spend copiously on private instruction the roster of college team have become predominantly white nearly percent at some small schoolsin the end some in the higher education community believe that last week admission fraud scandal while an embarrassing lesson in what policy change need to be made is nevertheless creating a false impression of the state of admission procedure at american collegesthere is now this notion that admission is a competitive cesspool and it not said michael reilly the executive director of the american association of college registrar and admission officer in fact reilly added most campus nationwide fail to meet their enrollment goal but then we have this segment thats highly competitive and ha created a completely different dynamic if i were on those campus id be sitting down and saying let rethink how were doing thisjoe drape ellen almer durston and alain delaquérière contributed reportingadvertisement
