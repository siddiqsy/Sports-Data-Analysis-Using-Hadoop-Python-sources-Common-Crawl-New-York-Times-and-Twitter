scoffed at by some officialsthe precision time system created more than two decade ago by former referee mike costabile currently is used at nearly every level of the sport including the nba and college basketball ncaa tournament costabile estimate by stopping the clock automatically on a referee whistle can save roughly second formerly lost to reaction time when timekeeper manually stopped the clockthe improved technology also make the ref whistle essentially their fingerprint the system us a specific type of whistle with calibration precise enough to identify the sound coming from each official that allows the system to produce an ondemand list of every start and stoppage and who caused itwhile the data isnt being used to evaluate official for thing such a tournament assignment costabile said that wealth of information can be used however conference see fit in the futurei think it make u all better clock official said veteran official mike eades who ha worked four final four and in numerous major conference ive been doing it a long time it kind of second nature i know it going to stop it i know ive got to start it and i know im always looking at the clock to make sure it running when it should be or stop when it shouldntany time were able to catch it when it doesnt do one or the other and fix it right away it make u look like hey those guy know what theyre doingofficials are so accustomed to having precision time that they instinctively check the clock on each whistle and reach for their beltpack button on every stoppagethe best example is that like a golf club in a golfer hand the official that use precision time it becomes a part of how they do what they do said jd collins the ncaa national coordinator of men basketball officiatingwe have signal that we use when we start the clock well now youve got one hand on the box youve got one hand out you count time differently it change some signaling mechanic but because it used so widely the top official all know how to use it and it becomes part of their dna quite franklyprecision time ha long been used in most major conference for men and woman college basketball the ncaa adopted the system for it tournament in the same year collins assumed his job after year of refereeing game using precision timethat wasnt necessarily the goal when costabile created the system in the s back then it wa simply about giving official the ability to instantly stop the clock on any foul or outofbounds call then control exactly when it restartsnow it a routine part of the game largely going unnoticedits great technology it help our guy said atlantic coast conference coordinator of men basketball officiating bryan kersey adding it habitual it part of our game and it here foreverthe system us a microphone attached near the referee whistle a beltpack on their waist transmits a clockstopping radio signal at the whistle and one to restart it when the referee press the button on the pack side that signal go to a base station at the scorer table to start and stop the clockthat station ha a manual control for a timekeeper though only a a backstopfrom the time referee blow the whistle which is at the speed of light over to the scorer table again were using radio wave once it hears the frequency of the whistle it stop the clock said costabile who life in north carolina after a career of officiating high school college and nba game it that fastcostabile estimate it take to second sometimes longer for a timekeeper to react to a whistle and manually stop the clock and with roughly to whistle per game for foul or outofbounds call those added second are invaluable at the end of game when referee often turn to replay to adjust the clockand with college basketball fan around the country counting down the second at the final four this weekend in minneapolis official will be counting on the systemit wasnt always that way costabile remembers when some skeptical league needed convincing when it came to adopting his thennew technologysure they thought i wa crazy costabile said and then all of a sudden they finally started seeing that these problem in their game were really there and they go well maybe this thing will fix it and it didkersey a former official who used precision time for year recall costabile bringing his invention to acc official for a demonstration so impressed kersey left the room saying whoaone of the thing that we stress in all of our meeting and all of our memo and training video is clock awareness so this doe give them that kersey said because we want them to start it on every live ball so it make them hit the button and look at the clock to see that it ha startedsame thing we want them to blow the whistle and notice the clock we want them to know the difference in the game clock and the shot clock so it make them better at being clock aware of the whole gamethe system isnt designed to take the human element out of officiating it just ensures ref are taking full advantage of the technologythe only human reaction time we have now is coming from the official costabile said because they have to visually see the play and then react and call a foulwhen the referee blow the whistle the clock stop on the whistle and thats what they want especially when the game tight costabile added you want to have that clock stopping because the team thats fouling late want the time to give them the opportunity to score______advertisement

angeles lakers point guard that maxim must be amended for johnson neither the front office nor the bench proved to be a winning or even comfortable habitat like the hardwood he used a a launching pad to basketball immortalityjohnsons forgettable coaching career with the lakers lasted just game at the close of the season before he unhappily vowed never to return to that occupation then this week johnson twoyear reign a the lakers president of basketball operation ended even more ignominiouslyhe abruptly announced his resignation before the team final game of an enormously disappointing season then revealed that he had told the news medium of the decision before he had informed his bos jeanie bus in order to deny bus an opportunity to talk him out of itjohnson of course ha stunned the world before with his announcement and early retirement in because he wa found to be hiv positive followed by his brief return to basketball in he spent the ensuing two decade constructing a business and entertainment empire replete with a highly successful chain of movie theater and an ownership stake in the storied los angeles dodger but johnson always insisted that he wa first and foremost a lakerhandling his exit in such a haphazard manner ha earned johnson untold amount of criticism in the day since given how much the lakers mean to southern californian and how unexpected this news wa yet he seems prepared to take the hit in exchange for the opportunity to return to his more customary postplaying life on the other side a he described it forever a laker but officially unattached to any teami like to be free johnson saidbut his freedom come at a steep cost to johnson to the lakers to a hollywood belief in well magicit turn out magic johnson who piloted some of the greatest team in nba history will not be the savior who help the lakers escape their longest run of futilityafter last summer blockbuster signing of lebron james johnson proclaimed the lakers to be back with the promise of a return to full back back status this summer once they acquired at least one superstar sidekick to james johnson ha instead fled just when the most crucial work wa about to commence with no clear path to bringing that second star to a flailing franchise that last reached the playoff in and last won a championship in when he convened an impromptu news conference tuesday night rather than reveal his updated plan to restore the lakers to title contention and placate a frustrated fan base johnson did just the opposite describing himself a happier when i wasnt the president he explained that the condition and pressure attached to building a championship team around james meant that the real magic couldnt come outin a series of rambling interview with a number of news outlet while the lakers were in the process of losing their regularseason finale to the portland trail blazer johnson spoke of how he had longed to send a congratulatory tweet to oklahoma city russell westbrook or to tutor ben simmons the rising philadelphia er star without inciting a storm of tampering allegationsi knew if i stayed in the role he said im giving up a lot of mesuch disclosure of course only served to validate much of the skepticism that greeted buss decision to install johnson a the new face of the lakers basketball operation in february rival frontoffice executive questioned johnson lack of experience in the modern game and his willingness to embrace the allencompassing nature of the job from the moment he wa named to replace the muchmaligned jim bus jeanies brother and mitch kupchak the longtime lakers executive those question only rose in volume when bus named a magic sidekick another frontoffice neophyte rob pelinka kobe bryants polarizing former agentthere were red flag from the start in taking on his first active role with an nba team since his second retirement a a player in johnson admitted that he had much to learn about navigating the in and out of the nbas complex salary cap and the rhythm of a job that had evolved so much in his time awaythe main part for me is really learning the other part that i didnt know and that is to understand the cba the salary cap where we are in term of the salary cap and who a freeagenttobe johnson told usa today of the challenge he faced in building a roster and understanding the collective bargaining agreementpart of the issue might have been that johnson could never just be a basketball executive he is a mogul and a cultural force while other nba team primarily lean on decision maker focusing solely on basketball johnson seemed to always have his eye on something bigger than the game itself reaching with his business tentacle to a many corner a possiblejohnson acquired a percent share of the lakers in before selling his stake in he even once hosted a syndicated latenight talk show s the magic hour and he wa never just about one game either acquiring a minority stake in the dodger in and one in the los angeles football club of major league soccer in business had clearly been on johnson mind when he took the lakers frontoffice job in he told cbs this morning in an interview at the time that he had turned down other offer to run a franchise including the embattled knicks but that he felt it wa the right time to rejoin the lakersat this point in my life you know i think that i can do it right now because my business are running smooth johnson said i can turn them over to my executive team that i have in that same interview he said i always wanted to be the male oprahjohnson wa one of the first athlete to build an empire for himself outside professional sport he went from whipping behindtheback pass and being the engine that made the s showtime lakers rev to investing in more than starbucks and burger king location among many other business investment all while flashing his famed charismatic grin according to a basketball reference estimate johnson made about million from nba salary alone not including endorsement now his net worth is in the hundred of millionsthe business of reviving the lakers however proved beyond him bus a a result is already facing pressure to rebound from her nostalgic faith in johnson to pursue a more accomplished executive this time such a golden state bob myers or san antonios r c buford to plot the team recovery from a season soaked in drama and dysfunctionbizarre a the timing seemed johnson insisted to reporter that there were no hidden reason for leaving other than the desire a he put it to espns rachel nichols to stop letting myself down by not being magic johnsonwhats clear is that walking away when he did spared him from firing coach luke walton something walton and his assistant coach according to two people with knowledge of the situation who were not authorized to discus it publicly had been bracing for this week walton culpability for the lakers record is a matter of debate given all of this season injury but johnson desire to make a change had been widely anticipated in league circle for week if not month buss wellchronicled fondness for walton is thought to be the only thing that had kept him in place throughout johnson reigni would have to affect someone livelihood and their life johnson told reporter tuesday night seemingly confirming that he wa poised to fire walton and i thought about that thats not fun for me thats not who i amthere had never been a player like johnson before he wa drafted out of michigan state a the first pick in the nba draft his court vision quickness length and versatility made him a dominant presence and led to his winning three most valuable player award and five nba championship he became perhaps the defining face of what it mean to be a laker no easy feat given the deep well of great player who have worn their familiar purpleandgold jerseybut the fact that bus ha yet to address the news medium beyond a brief statement insisting that the organization still believed there is no greater los angeles laker than earvin johnson speaks to the team level of shock that he would step down without warningat a speaking engagement at chapman university on april bus acknowledged that the lakers havent lived up to the brand my father created referring to one of the most successful owner in the history of american team sport jerry bus the signing of james in free agency last summer for which johnson is sometimes subjected to claim that his closer role wa overstated could not prevent the lakers from extending their playoff drought to a franchiseworst sixth consecutive season that figure match the knicks for the league thirdlongest active drought behind sacramento season and phoenix ninenow the onus fall squarely on bus to find a successor to repair a roster in need of overhaulto johnson relief such issue are no longer his concern he return now to a world he may have felt increasingly more comfortable with anyway in recent

advertisementsupported byby marc tracya federal judge in manhattan on tuesday sentenced three men in a college basketball fraud case to between six and nine month in prison lenient sentence that the judge said were nonetheless important to deter the funneling of money to the family of college basketball prospect an ncaa violation that a jury found last year also constituted a felonythe sentence come ahead of a second trial next month at which more may be revealed about how widespread the rot in recruiting ha spreadjames gatto the former head of global basketball marketing at adidas wa sentenced to nine month by u district court judge lewis a kaplan merl code jr another former adidas employee and christian dawkins an aspiring agent were given six month each code and dawkins who are also defendant in next month trial were ordered to pay restitution of a little more than each with gattos amount of restitution still to be determinedkaplan ruled that the punishment would not go into effect until the appeal process is completed the defendant have two week to ask the federal circuit court to reexamine the casea jury convicted the three men last fall of defrauding the university of louisville and in gattos case also north carolina state university and the university of kansa the men participated in a scheme in which the family of highly rated men basketball recruit were offered money in exchange for pledge to play for one of those team which are sponsored by adidas prosecutor argued that by unknowingly making the university vulnerable to ncaa sanction the defendant had victimized the schoolssuch offer are barred by ncaa rule which require that college athlete adhere to the association policy of amateurism and not be compensated for their participation in their sport beyond a scholarship and related cost of attendancerepercussions from the charge brought by the u attorney for the southern district of new york have already included the firing of a hall of fame coach rick pitino formerly of louisville who denies wrongdoing and whom prosecutor did not charge a kansa player wa ruled ineligible early this year after his connection to the scheme came to lightthe lawyer for code and dawkins welcomed the sentencehappy might be the wrong word but the judge granted a lenient sentence said steve haney who represents dawkinshaney also promised that the second trial which involves alleged bribe to assistant coach at top men basketball program would not only exonerate dawkins but would also show how college basketball business is really donewere going to pull back the cover he said adding this could transform college basketball and put the player in a situation moving forward so they and their labor are treated fairlyhaney pledged to put coach on the stand a many a i can get into the courtroomrobert s khuzami the acting u attorney for the southern district of new york in this case said in a statement the sentence imposed today only begin to reflect the magnitude of the harm these defendant caused through a scheme that not only defrauded multiple public university but upended the life of young studentathletes and corrupted a game cherished by so manytuesdays sentencing hearing in a packed courtroom on a high floor of the federal district building in downtown manhattan saw all three defendant a well a their lawyer address the court and plead for leniency they requested no jail time at all while most of these statement referred to the defendant personal character some of the attorney also pointed to the unusual nature of the case which depended on a theory in which the university were victimized by the defendant attempt to secure them top talent albeit while putting them at risk of ncaa penaltiesif he thought that anyone would conceive what he did here a a crime he would never have done it code lawyer mark moore said of his clientcomparing the situation in the case to a legal principle called the doctrine of unclean hand moore suggested that widespread illicit activity in college recruiting called into question who wa truly responsible for the harm his client had purportedly causedadidas ha financial contract with louisville through which louisville profited moore saidyou have not seen louisville or any of these school look to get out of their contract with adidas since the scandal broke in he addedmoore noted that although it wa not admitted into the record before the jury kaplan seemed to recall an earlier scandal at louisville in which a basketball staffer paid stripper and prostitute to entertain recruit and player in oncampus housingindeed kaplan himself appeared to raise socalled strippergate which resulted in ncaa penalty during the prosecutor edward b diskants statement to the court in which diskant insisted that the university were the victimskaplan said that the defendant had committed a serious crime one whose purportedly common nature wa not by itself exonerating the everybodys doing it argument in short is not a get out of jail free card he saidbut the judge also recognized that the alleged behavior of university employee like assistant coach and perhaps the interest of the university themselves complicated the theory of the case on which a jury convicted that the university were victimsreferring to brian tug bowen jr a prospect whose father testified that he had indirectly taken from adidas in exchange for bowens commitment to louisville kaplan said to me probably the worst the most seriously injured victim of the louisville scheme wa tug bowen bowen wa declared ineligible and is now playing professionally in australiaon wiretap defendant made oblique reference to their activity being typical of highprofile men college basketball they also suggested that at least one of adidass rival were involved in similar scheme though there have been no further chargeslast year yahoo sport revealed document that purported to show the family of several former

frustration a the ball rimmed out then rose and hit both free throw someone in the sparsely populated stand yelled congratulation chris given the size of the crowd it almost certain clemons heard himthe second free throw wa clemonss nd point of the night and the nd of his fourseason career at campbell a private university about an hour drive south of raleigh nc his hometown it also meant clemons a senior had entered the top of the men division i college basketball career scoring list passing the former kansa star danny manning by the end of the game when clemons had finished off a seasonhigh point effort he had passed oscar robertson tooits kind of a gift and a curse that youre not really able to enjoy the moment or that i chose not to rather clemons said i do understand the significance of the eventshistory is being made in college basketball this season but not all of it is being made for team that are likely bound for the final four or by player who are projected to be selected early in the next nba draftwith career point at campbell clemons is two behind hersey hawkins the former bradley player for eighth all time heading into thursday game with high point at south dakota state another senior mike daum is poised to break into the top by season end with point he could pas manning in the jackrabbit game on thursday against fort wayneit is an unignorable fact that most of the player still ahead of clemons and daum on the career scoring list are not household name either after hawkins for instance clemons could pas keydren clark who played for st peter in jersey city harry kelly of texas southern in houston and perhaps even alphonso ford of mississippi valley state who hold fourth place with point first place by a country mile with point is the louisiana state legend pete maravich even though he played only three seasonsi recognize that a lot of people on that list who scored a lot of point in college didnt go on to have successful nba career said hawkins who did have a successful nba career and now work for the portland trail blazersfreeman williams who is second and the scorer of point for portland state acknowledged that his college year had been his glory day i got most of my attention a a basketball player back then he saidclemons and daum fit in the same category daum is a twotime and probable threetime summit league player of the year clemons is leading all division i player in scoring this season averaging nearly point a game although both are likely to get opportunity to shine during the nbas summer league or on it development league roster said fran fraschilla the former coach and espn draft analyst the foot inch daum is at best a latesecondround draft pick clemons who is listed at is unlikely to be drafted at allthe relative anonymity of college basketball leading career scorer appears to be a feature not a bug if you are scoring so many point for so much time you most likely are not doing so at college basketball heightsif mike daum or chris clemons had gone to play in the big ten or the acc fraschilla said last week referring to the atlantic coast conference they wouldnt be on the verge of scoring pointshe added a good player a they are they would be on team with other really talented player a opposed to going to a school like sdsu or campbell where virtually from day their talent wa such that they were the dominant player not only on their team but in their leagueand had they dominated a they have in a bigger league they probably wouldnt be senior the best college basketball player are around for only one or two seasonslets not kid ourselves said lionel simmons who is third with career point for la salle some of these player if they didnt come out early they could have scored but even when top talent played for three or four college season they did so for top team whose other talented player lowered the individual demand on them superlative college player like uclas lew alcindor who later changed his name to kareem abduljabbar and georgetown patrick ewing had the kind of supporting cast that come with championship teamsthe most prominent name in the top after robertson is larry bird who played most of his college career at indiana state a team that he led to the final four but one that needed him to average point a game but a place on the list can still be a point of pride year laterhawkins acknowledged that he kept tab on development in the career scoring top in a blazer scout wa at the creighton game in which doug mcdermott now of the indiana pacer passed hawkins he wa texting me six point away two point away hawkins said he thought it wa funny i wa sitting at dinner getting texted every three minuteslast week clemons deflected postgame question about passing manning and robertson saying he wa focused on this season in which the fighting camel are third in the big south asked whether he had kept the game ball he laughed of course he had notafter it all said and done ill definitely go back and look reminisce on the year ive had here kind of be amazed at myself know what i wa able to accomplish clemons saidlike clemons daum emphasized in a telephone interview that he ha been putting his team first still he said he could not help noticing recently when he passed bird a well a duke j j redick and north carolina tyler hansbrough two star from the last decade whom daum had grown up watchingi feel like im going to look back on it his eventual scoring total maybe when im older and be like see how cool it wa to be in that position daum saidfor me personally he added it just getting ready for the next thingadvertisement

duke zion williamson the impossible freshman who move with a guard agility while weighing pound recovered a loose ball and hammered down a twohanded dunk with old testament furywilliamson is expected to be the top pick in this year nba draft and ha been this season signature player a quality so inseparable from his ferocious slam that a rare missed dunk last week against boston college became a highlight in it own rightthe only other player who ha come close to capturing the collective imagination a williamson is murray state ja morant a foot sophomore who ha played his way from virtual anonymity to likely topfive draft position on a diet of jordanesque leaping flying slamsthat williamson and morant are this season college basketball folk hero is in one sense entirely logical dunk

attempted morant is at percent below the division i average of percentwilliamsons attitude toward the pointer may be best summarized not by any of his own shot but by his sensational block of deandre hunter illfated attempt late in saturday game an duke victorytheir proficiency in dunking over longdistance shooting signal how special they are of course but also might herald a market correction in which basketball most reliable shot is back inin recent season the defining player the one who made the biggest impact and summed up the college basketball zeitgeist have overwhelmingly been

possible that after several year in which the pointer ha predominated in top offense coach have improved at devising defense to stymie perimeter shooting in that way placing a premium on wing player

but he dunk on the way up he added of williamson his head is literally at or over the rim every timerecent season emphasis on the wa easy to understand if you looked to the nbas discovery of the

lopsided matchup and consequent blowout in turn a bythenumbers opening weekend by all right ought to lead to the best basketball of the season a superior team scrap against one another for a national

of the two chalkiest first and second round ever the regionals produced the best second weekend of the ncaa tournament in year and potentially set up two or three more great gamesthis year regional

fool you if all these program do not have the same pedigree all these individual team belongon sunday auburn coach bruce pearl anointed the tiger the cinderella of this tournament it helped that they had just successively bumped off three of the sport most redoubtable blue blood kansa north carolina and kentucky it also helped that pearl is an enthusiastic salesman at best we will be hearing more

virginia commonwealth variety that too wa a tournament that began with unusually few upsetsdane fife the michigan state associate head coach offered some theory that could explain these recent influx of firsttime final four participant drawn not from the pool of outofnowhere midmajor team but from the league that dominate contemporary college basketball and with the right coach can have access to it best playerswere losing a lot of kid early u a a college basketball business and the transfer have really spread the wealth fife said referring to the increased prevalence of oneanddones and even twoanddones at the top program where the best player tend to congregate anywaythats added to the parity in college hoop he saidtexas tech for instance ha three senior who were nonetheless effectively recruited by the thirdyear coach chris beard transferring from other program fife noted that michigan state had also looked at matt mooney a guard who had played at air force and south dakota before electing to transfer to a highmajor teamvirginia and michigan state the two favorite are constructed with a pinch of young talent the virginia sophomore deandre hunter likely to be a firstround draft

advertisementsupported byon pro basketballthe nba had it reason for forcing new orleans to play it superstar after a trade request but the risk is not worth the rewardby marc steincharlotte nc some of the most memorable scene from the nbas th allstar game played out away from the ball both on and adjacent to the bench of the squad captained by lebron jamestwo very deep pointer from damian lillard sparked a comeback from point down that had some of the game biggest name bounding farther onto the floor in the celebration than the rule would ever allow in a game that count and in that same corner of spectrum center another spectacle percolated anthony davis the disgruntled new orleans pelican superstar spending the entire second half a a rather forlorn spectatorthose close enough to see it simply couldnt miss the contrastdavis tested his freshly tweaked left shoulder in warmups registered point in five minute and then opted for safety and what passed for solitude while a raucous rally unfolded around him led by lillard and the allstar mvp kevin durant team lebron climbed out of that huge hole to record a victory over the team captained by giannis antetokounmpo yet it wa a muted end to the league annual party weekend for the player whose future ha generated more noise than anyone or anything in basketball since september thats when davis hired the klutch sport agent rich paul who is also james agent and one of the superstar closest friend to precipitate a seemingly ceaseless stream of chatter about davis winding up alongside james on the los angeles lakers that might still happen even though the league annual trade deadline ha passed and even with davis revealing in a wild interview session saturday that he is more open to being dealt to the boston celtic than had been previously described no one is prepared to suggest that the lakers are out of this trade chasethe firmest and smartest declaration to be made at this juncture is that davis reverse layup and swished pointer from the left wing sunday night should be the last two shot he take for the rest of the season it is time for the pelican league official and davis camp to collectively decide that the wisest move for all party is to shelve the brow for new orleans remaining gamesdavis ha every right like countless allstars before him to request a trade the sport best have anointed james their muscleflexing role model and are taking greater control of their future than ever before why shouldnt they if they have the juiceonce that happens though davis team should be able to protect the franchise interest above anything else new orleans ha not been granted that rightit emerged jan that davis through paul informed the pelican that he would not be signing the fiveyear million contract extension they were planning to offer july and that he wanted to be traded instead new orleans spent the ensuing day before the trade deadline fielding offer for davis mostly from the overzealous lakers but did so knowing all along that the pool of worthy offer would be wider if they waited until junewhen the deadline predictably passed on feb with no deal new orleans wa ordered by the nba to play davis for the rest of the season even though a precedent had already been set to give the team full control in similar case involving houston carmelo anthony and memphis chandler parson davis ha played in four game since routinely taking the proverbial air out of the pelican when he been on the court and in his most recent appearance injuring his shoulderthe pelican dont want davis in the lineup because of the gloom his ongoing presence spawn but also to try to avoid a serious injury that could adversely affect his trade value the nbas position is that they differentiate between true gamechangers like davis and mortal player it is my position that they absolutely should nottwo of the league main justification in this case after all hold that the pelican would be willfully hurting the ticketbuying public by holding davis out and that the potential benefit new orleans could realize in term of improving it draft lottery odds in may violates league rule governing competitive integrity both ring increasingly hollowthe toxic atmosphere at new orleans home game where some customer were spotted last week wearing paper bag over their head in a scene straight out of the depressing new orleans aints day of yesteryear is suddenly such that playing davis is also an affront to pelican fan they know their face of the franchise no longer want to be thererival team meanwhile can whine all they want about the pelican supposedly trying to improve their draft pick in june by sitting davis now the truth is any team in new orleans position resigned to trading davis and getting a much a possible in return would want to put him in bubble wrap a quickly a possibledavis made it clear sunday night after his quiet cameo that he still want to play out the season a much a nba commissioner adam silver want the same silver conceded in an interview sunday with espn radio that the awkward dance resulting from davis trade demand had indeed become a distractionits a very unhealthy situation for the team and frankly for anthony a well silver saidcall that the polite description the tnt analyst charles barkley and shaquille oneal both of whom navigated their own complicated trade saga a player were openly critical of davis and paul throughout their allstar dutyi think they probably should have done it this summer and done it a little bit more quietly oneal said in an offset interview because now anthony davis is in a bad position a a player you never want the fan to think you dont careeven after davis hired paul i expected a scenario closer to what shaq outlined i thought davis would play the season out to his fullest inform the pelican he would pas on the extension and thus force them to trade him without ever explicitly requesting a trade that approach seemingly would have meshed better with davis reserved personality the path he chose instead ha made the previously beloved davis an unlikely villain that too shall pas with time paul george jimmy butler and kawhi leonard are fellow elite talent who have found themselves labeled similarly over the past month after davis is ultimately traded in july it will eventually be someone else who becomes the nbas villainbut july is a way off although there no way to gain real distance from the davis distraction until a trade materializes pelican official believe it can be tangibly diminished by sending him away for the rest of the season especially with two of new orleans first four game after the allstar break coming against lebrons lakersthere were strong signal in charlotte that the pelican with danny ferry now serving a their acting general manager in the wake of friday firing of dell demps intend to reengage the nba this week in hope of convincing league official to rethink their stance about forcing them to play davisthe nba player association would presumably get involved if new orleans is successful but id advise the pelican to hold firm take any fine that come the team ha played better scrappier ball without davis anyway and heaven forbid he suffers a serious injury in the regular season dog day a opposed to a mere dumpster fire to borrow new orleans coach

advertisementsupported byon pro basketballby scott cacciolasacramento the boston celtic were not in a good place when they boarded a plane bound for california on sunday they were coming off a home loss to the houston rocket that point guard kyrie irving punctuated by using a total of word to answer nine question in his postgame news conferenceat one point he wa asked whether he thought the team could cobble together some momentum on it west coast tripwell see he whisperedjust one season removed from a run to the nbas eastern conference final and seemingly improved by the readdition of gordon hayward and the continued development of their young core the celtic were on the brink of falling apart any hope they still harbored of being a championshipready team wa a brittle a a toothpickbut after some reflection and conversation the celtic regained a bit of their swagger with backtoback win this week against the golden state warrior and the sacramento king the celtic will see if they can keep the good vibe going on saturday against the los angeles lakers which is anything but certain especially for irving whose season ha been clouded by question about his future with the teamsuch uncertainty doe not make irving unique in the modern nba kevin durant of the warrior and kawhi leonard of the toronto raptor are among the other star who will weigh big decision in free agency this summer but the celtic have let the noise affect themwith the two win this week improving their record to the celtic may be showing sign that they are finally mercifully learning how to copethat long plane ride helped u out irving said after tuesday lopsided victory over the warrior ill just say that we needed it we needed it we were going to get to a point where we were just going to get tired of fighting each other fighting the outside world when it doesnt really matter so we just wanted to come out here and play basketballthis is our sanctuary and we have to do everything we can to protect it we cant let anyone infiltrate itirving who missed wednesday win against the king with a left thigh contusion is averaging a teamleading point a game along with assist and rebound both career high he is also shooting percent from the field and percent from point rangehe also rank among the nba leader in mercurial behavior he ha been vague about the specific source of his discontent but it may have something to do with his pending free agencyirving backed off an earlier pledge to resign with the celtic after they struggled at the start of the season in fact during a trip to new york to play the knicks on feb he told a group of reporter in his own colorfully abrasive way that he did not owe anyone anything the knicks of course would be interested in signing irving a sixtime allstar who grew up in new jersey and ha a soft spot for madison square gardenthen came the allstar break and a clip of irving and durant having an inaudible conversation found it way to the internet where an army of amateur lip reader tried to decode what they were saying worth noting irving and durant are close friend also worth noting the knicks will have enough cap space this summer for two max contractsirving refused to shed light on their chat and said it wa nobody business which wa his prerogative but it had the general effect of using a napkin to mop up an oil spillsince then irving ha been alluding to nefarious force and the steep cost of celebrity saying he hate the spotlight even a he sell sneaker and moonlight a an actor he reiterated his disdain this week after collecting point and assist against the warrior his th doubledouble this seasonthe business part of it is just what make it terrible for me honestly dealing with all this he said referring to the reporter around him im going to be honest with you guy the basketball part of it i have to keep that fun thats where im great being around my teammate thats what make me happy and the business part of it is going to be businessit wa not lost on anyone who witnessed this exchange that irving wa bashing the business of basketball while wearing an uncle drew ball cap the same uncle drew character he popularized in soft drink commercial and then parlayed into a movie released last yearas for the basketball itself well boston ha had an uneven season the product of a team that is not nearly lakerslevel dysfunctional but is not exactly cohesive either the celtic arrived for their game against the warrior having lost five of their last six game and their locker room wa a joyless placeperhaps they needed to get away from boston perhaps they needed perspective perhaps irving needed to speak with danny ainge the team president of basketball operation and brad stevens it coach who reminded irving that the team still had a lot of season left to play it wa not over not yet not by any stretchevery team ha to find a togetherness in competing stevens said some team it take game some team it take game and bad team never get there we hope that it took u game but well see we havent proven ourselves to be great at that yet for a long stretch of timein their win against the warrior the celtic had assist on field goal they also communicated when irving and forward jaylen brown botched a play that led to an early turnover brown patted himself on the chest to apologize then appeared to apologize a second time on their next trip up the courtthe next night in sacramento irving sat behind the visiting bench for the celtic victory over the king he wa vocal he did a lot of fistpumping and he celebrated when hayward le than hour after scoring point against the warrior connected on the gamewinnerafter suffering a grisly ankle injury in the opening game and missing last season hayward ha struggled to find a rhythm in his return maybe he found it here in california along with the rest of the team the celtic are too talented to let this opportunity go to waste because who know how long it will lastas long

samuel l jackson announced from the dolby theater stage in los angeles that lee beloved knicks had beaten the san antonio spur at madison square garden to halt a franchiserecord home losing streak at consecutive defeatslee who wa moment away from winning his first competitive oscar appeared to mouth back to jackson that the knicks were trying to tank nbaspeak for team that seek to improve their

the knicks most famous fan won the oscar that had eluded him for more than year and surely knew a well a anyone that one measly victory even over the spur and their decorated coach gregg popovich wouldnt knock the team too far off course in it shameless bid to finish at the bottom of the standingsbut the exchange and ensuing wave of social medium chatter shined the brightest of unwanted spotlight on a subject that nba official undoubtedly wish would not have surfaced in this mannerfor it is the public discourse that surround tanking which inevitably lead to otherwise passionate fan like lee openly wishing for their team to lose that ha long been regarded at league headquarters a the most unsavory element of the practicetanking in itself can be a foolhardy strategy especially in the wake of a procedural change this season this is the first year since the inception of the nbas draft lottery in that the team holding the three lowest win total will share flattened odds of percent each of landing the no selection in junepreviously the team with the worst record had a percent chance of winning the top overall pick but commissioner adam silver push for socalled lottery reform ha made it even tougher for the worst team in pro basketball currently the phoenix sun who at are a game behind the knicks to win the right to presumably select the highly coveted duke freshman zion williamsonif only there were clear measure to be taken to try to drown out the persistent tanking talk that seemingly and loudly swirl around every bad nba team corrosive is the word silver used at his annual allstar weekend news conference in charlotte nc this monthi personally dont think it a winning strategy over the long term to engage in multiple year of rebuilding silver said there a mindset that if youre going to be bad you might a well be really bad i believe personally thats corrosive for those organizationsthe philadelphia er are the rare franchise in position to differ they amassed a load of lottery pick and other trade asset across a threeyear window of intentional losing during the polarizing reign of their former general manager sam hinkie who stepped down in april in response to a reduction in his authority over basketball matter before having the chance to reap the full benefit of all his team futilityseveral of hinkies highprofile draftee jahlil okafor nerlens noel and dario saric fell well short of becoming the sort of fulcrum team build around ditto for the no overall pick markelle fultz who wa drafted by bryan colangelo hinkies initial replacement but the two selection who did become franchise player joel embiid by hinkie and ben simmons two month after hinkies exit now find themselves flanked by the former allstar jimmy butler and a potential future allstar in tobias harris butler and harris arrived via trade that the sixer new general manager elton brand wa able to swing this season on the strength of the various trade chip philadelphia had stockpiled under hinkieit is too early to say whether silver lotteryreform crusade will actually quell further tanking attempt from team pondering the philadelphia model but it ha a chance the flattened odds of winning the lottery mean that the sun knicks and cleveland cavalier who currently comprise the bottom three team all face a daunting percent chance that someone else win the zion sweepstakes when the lottery is held may one can safely assume that lee and countless other knicks fan will be shouting le flattering thing a opposed to just mouthing them if all this losing they have endured this season lead to drafting someone other than williamsonsince the knicks are now linked with the dallas maverick having narrowly avoided breaking that team league record of straight home loss with that unexpected triumph over san antonio on sunday it is worth remembering what happened to the maverick that seasonwith jamal mashburn a their star rookie rather than chris webber or penny hardaway after the maverick fell to the no overall pick the previous offseason despite boasting the highest odds of winning the draft lottery they posted a recordthat is the type of cautionary tale that silver even a tanking talk persists can forever serve up to discourage actual tanking in the year history of the lottery only eight time ha the team with the worst record managed to win the no pickat least one knicks fan in hollywood find the idea of tanking in professional sport to be a horrible thing to even think about the actor leon robinson who starred in above the rim and cool running and ha made numerous appearance at the garden this season said in a phone interview monday im never happy to see my team lose im in the garden people go crazy every time they even get close to winning every time theyre losing people are shaking their head at halftime so im confused why are you coming to the gamelee however is hardly alone in lusting after williamson it an open secret that the knicks are dreaming of a mammoth freeagent coup this summer with the more than million of salarycap space they can clear kevin durant and kyrie irving are widely regarded a the knicks top two target but make no mistake the knicks themselves not just a segment of the fan base are dreaming of zion too no matter what history saysgiven the immediate oncourt impact one extremely gifted young man can

flutter across it at foot inch and pound he ha embraced his identity a a butterfly among a herd of cattlebut at this stage of his career williams want to feel a light and nimble a possible so he essentially starves himself on game day after a big breakfast he refuse to eat again until well after the game itself often going nearly hour between mealsit is one of several habit that williams ha developed over the year and one that clearly work for him it is also the opposite of how most elite athlete prepare for game but williams is different he want to take the court with an appetitethats crazy landry shamet the firstyear clipper guard said id weigh about pound if i did thatthe clipper a they often have this season turned to williams on monday night for an extraordinary performance this time against the golden state warrior in game of their firstround playoff series in the clipper win williams collected point and assist to help erase a point deficitshamet sealed the biggest comeback in nba playoff history with a goahead pointer with second left and the clipper evened the bestofseven series at one game apieceim one of those guy who can get hot said williams who shot of from the field and i just got lost in the momentthe clipper who have thrived behind williams in the wake of a midseason deal that sent tobias harris to the philadelphia er will need all of him again all his scoring all his savvy all his unusual ritual when the warrior come to los angeles for game on thursdaymake no mistake the clipper have their share of scrappy nononsense guy patrick beverley who ha spent the series covering the warrior kevin durant like aluminum foil would trash talk a telephone polewilliams on the other hand carry himself with a brand of quiet composure that ha a power all it ownhe go about his business said sam cassell an assistant coach for the clipper he not overwhelmingly faster than people he not bigger than people but he understands what he can do on the basketball court and he doe it wellthe warrior klay thompson recently came across a package of highlight clip from williams day a a star guard at south gwinnett high school outside of atlanta what stood out to thompson wa how little williams had changedhe played the exact same way thompson said in an interview before the start of the series it wa incredible same stepback jumper same hesitation same floaterswilliams ha stuck with the same general blueprint while refining his skill slicker craftier jazzier he ha also become more resilient there wa a time he said when he thought his career might be finished in he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee while playing for the atlanta hawk in his comeback he turned to kenny atkinson who wa then one of the team assistant to help reassemble his gameatkinson now the head coach of the net imbued williams with the importance of routinekenny is one of my alltime favorite people in the world williams said i give him a lot of credit for getting me back on my foot when i wa down and outby williams wa the nbas sixth man of the year with the toronto raptor but he ha never been better more efficient or more dynamic than he ha been in his last two season with the clipper all at an age early s when most player see their production begin to erodeinstead williams who ha scored more point off the bench than any other player in league history ha only improved this season he averaged point and assist in just minute a game williams also had the ball in his hand more than ever with the clipper running percent of their play through him whenever he wa on the court according to usagerate statistic compiled by basketball referencecoming off the bench wa never something that he necessarily wanted to do but williams ha no doubt that the role ha helped preserve his career because it ha kept his minute down he ha averaged minute a game over his year career lebron james by comparison ha averaged minutesits given me an opportunity to stretch my career out and i think im in my prime right now man williams said im just rollingat the same time williams ha his quirky custom which help give him a sense of stability starting with his gameday breakfast hash brown egg white french toast and chicken sausage along with a fruit smoothie that he sweetens with honey he load up because he know he wont eat again for a whilei guess my body gotten used to it williams said who will just do the smoothie if the clipper have an early tipoffhe also ha the peculiar habit of arriving at the arena on the late side about minute before the start of the gamei dont like idle time he saidonce there though williams ha an active schedule minute in the training room getting stretched out minute in the weight room doing exercise with a stretch band and a medicine ball then about minute on the court making field goal a cassell feed him passesbefore a recent home game ahead of the playoff williams made nearly percent of his attempt including two skyscraping moonshots from the baseline which is a shot that he ha developed in case a footer lunge at him with his arm extended williams say he only practice shot that he will attempt in game however improbable or acrobatici catch myself at least two or three time a game just putting my hand up like how did that even happen shamet saidwilliams wrap up his oncourt work by sinking free throw and running courtwidth sprint then retreat to the locker room to put on his ankle brace and check his phone just to make sure there no family emergency or anything like that he saidwith minute on the clock the clipper have their team meeting before they head to the court williams gather his teammate around him for one final huddle or rather they gather around him a if he ha some sort of gravitational pullonce the game begin williams take a seat on the bench which is the only time he stop moving but he is watching his potential defender and studying the flow readying himself for the moment when he shed his warmups late in the first quarterif cassell can pinpoint one flaw it might be that williams commits too many turnover he is an excellent passer especially coming off ball screen shamet considers him one of the most underrated passer in the league but he sometimes try to do too much cassell said so cassell will remind williams to do what he doe best shoot the ball it is what everyone want to see from williams who is regarded around the league a a player whom other player love to watchit mean a lot coming from my peer williams said i think a competitor thats why we get into this to gain respect from the guy who have played the game and you walk away and they say he wa a tough cover that dude wa niceall while being fueled with a hunger of

find their way into a rotationthe spur foundation and selfless identity were built with david robinson and tim duncan both no overall pick and special people but winning five championship requires

the first round of the ncaa tournament the previous year duke did it in and indiana in connecticut won the title a year after it had been barred from postseason play for poor academic performancebut nonetheless a win by topseeded virginia would be different of course it would be different not all loss are created equal and virginia tournament experience last year wa quite a moment to overcomeso many factor compounded last march to make the result of virginia game versus the university of maryland baltimore county so awful for the cavalier there wa the sheer history of being the first no seed ever to lose to a no seed in the men tournament there wa the fact that the game itself wa not close the cavalier lost by point there wa the size of the fall a virginia wa not only a top seed last year but the overall top seed deemed the very best team in the country only day before it stunning exit and umbc with it inspiring academic story and clever twitter feed wa an underdog a cheseapake retriever to be precise straight from central casting so magnetic that there wa barely time to feel bad for a virginia team that had just had the equivalent of a ton weight dropped on itthat day last march in charlotte nc when it wa time for the postgame news conference coach tony bennett elected not to have his outgoing senior star isaiah wilkins and devon hall join him at the dais he recalled saturday night after his team barely defeated fifthseeded auburn to reach this year final instead he tapped kyle guy and ty jerome two sophomore who he knew would be backin the end of that season bennett wa implicitly declaring lay the beginning of the nextyou guy need to be up there with me wa his message to guy and jerome then he said and we need to go through this and we need to go through next year togetherthe cavalier and their coach have since not cared to speak about that loss especially once this season began but over the course of this year tournament a they have dealt with slightly modified version of the exact same question every step of the way every round i say the same thing almost jerome said saturday and it feel a little bit sweeter it ha become clear that last year still loom large for the teamthe bad mojo seemed to have broken in virginia regionalfinal victory over purdue in which virginia had been bound for defeat until a missed free throw and a ball bounding into the backcourt led the freshman point guard kihei clark to make the play of the tournament sending a halfcourt pas to mamadi diakite who caught and released and swished the ball in at the buzzer to force an overtime period that virginia won by pointsbut then the auburn game happened again virginia trailed by point with only second left only this time guy wa fouled on a pointer he missed and he made all three shotsteam of destiny or luckyis there a differencetexas tech ha it own inspirational story a popular fact making the round is that if the red raider who looked dominant defeating secondseeded michigan state on saturday night win it all theirs would be only the second division i men championship awarded to a team from the lone star state after the title that texas western so famously wonbut texas tech historic underachievement in men basketball is the more relevant narrative thread virginia is considered insufficiently blueblooded because this is only it third final four by contrast this year wa only texas tech second round of the first wa last year that is pretty neatand even that trajectory lack the drama of virginia a no le a figure than texas tech coach chris beard pointed out saturday night like all other college basketball fan from the heartbreak of last year to be playing in the national championship on monday night he said it a story that you pull forthe team do not present an especially compelling contrast on the court texas tech doe not play a slow a virginia nobody doe but it play pretty slow virginia relies on pointer more than texas tech doe texas tech force more turnover than virginia doe but virginia give up far fewer turnover than texas tech doesvirginia wa the better team before the ncaa tournament when it lost only to duke not only a supertalented team but a nightmare matchup and to florida state in the atlantic coast conference tournament while texas tech bowed out of the big tournament in it opening game to a west virginia team that had a losing recordin the ncaa tournament though texas tech ha been far better the red raider have won their five game including those against two no seed and topseeded gonzaga by an average of point while the cavalier against worse competition have an average victory margin of nearly half that and under half that if one count the purdue game a a regulation tiebut college basketball doe not decide it champion by deciding who it best team is if it did virginia would have been last year national champion and because it doe not virginia ha a chance to be this yearsbennett virginia coach is an openly spiritual man so it is not that surprising that before saturday night stunningly close victory over auburn he offered his team a prescient little sermon on the loaf and the fishesthat is the biblical story of what happened when jesus suggested to his disciple that they feed men and woman the disciple said they had neither enough food to feed so many people nor the money to buy more all they had in fact wa five loaf of bread and two fishin the story jesus took the food gave thanks broke the loaf and handed the piece to the disciple who handed them to the people somehow it multiplied they all ate and were satisfied the book of matthew say according to the book of john the feat took place near the jewish holiday of passover just like the final fourthat wa enough to feed everyone the virginia junior braxton key said after saturday game recounting the storyin other word the overtime win over purdue wa enough a the point win over auburn turned out to be enough and a a victory over texas tech after a standout season and a haphazard tournament would be enoughcoach wa saying what we have right now is enough key said and it definitely will

sometimes you cant fight city hallsuch ha been the theme of this season tournament after it first weekend and it first two round there is a school of thought that the perfect tournament would feature all favorite winning after all that is exactly the point of the seed but any casual fan in fact especially any casual fan know that the unlikely win and the stunning loss lie at the very heart of the ncaa tournament broad appealit is only the second time that the top seed were all among the regional semifinalist since the bracket expanded to team in according to the tournament medium coordinator

only an accountant could lovesimilarly oregon defeat of wisconsin in the first round wa technically a no vsno upset but the duck were coming off a run to the pacific conference tournament title and several oddsmakers had cast the game a pick emonly no ohio state win over no iowa state and no californiairvines defeat of no kansa state qualified a the kind of classic firstround upset that

commonwealth in or loyolachicago last year ha someone been cleaning the eraser because it sure feel chalky in hereso a the ancient hebrew used to ask why is this ncaa tournament different from all well most other ncaa tournamentsfor one thing apparently you should trust the selection committee seedings this wa the first year without the muchmaligned rating percentage index statistic which did not account for factor like average margin of victory and the first year with the much more comprehensive ncaa evaluation tool known a net which doesthen again the committee stillbaffling decision to leave out highnet low rpi north carolina state now in the national invitation tournament quarterfinal and admit lownet highrpi arizona state won a playin game lost to buffalo by suggests net wa not the beall endall maybe the committee wa wise in other way or maybe it got luckyperhaps the roster of team that have survived and advanced confirms that college basketball ha reached a new degree of the winnertakeall dynamic with the best coach and the best recruit congregating at fewer and fewer program a dynamic both fed and exacerbated by higher salary and oneanddones so that the top team have too much talent to be toppledpossibly but the last time top seed made up of the final wa arguably the last year before oneanddones came to define college basketball that year featured the last nba draft without a freshman in it top three for instanceit could be that the bracket is trending in a more favoriteheavy direction the tournament two year ago wa notably chalky a well it also could be that this tendency ebb and flow the only year since in which all four top seed made the final four wa in predicting what happens next then we could do worse than to look at that bracket which is also the only other one that had three top seed from the same conference and eerily also featured among the regional semifinalist the top seed two no seed a no seed and a no seed from the pacific then known a the pacificin that year the four top seed all advanced to the regional final two made the final four and one lasted through the national title gamethe top overall seed louisville lost in the regional final to the no seed in it quadrant michigan state this year the no seed in the quadrant of the top overall seed duke is michigan statethose spartan made the national championship game only to lose to that last top seed which had been ranked third overall by the tournament selector north carolina this year equivalent the no seed rated third overall on the other side of the bracket is north carolinasince then the tar heel have been to two more national championship game two year ago they won one however a a reporter reminded tar heel coach roy williams on saturday his team had

the eyeball testa kansa show we are not in rpiland anymore and it is difficult to find close observer of college basketball who do not think this is a good thingby and large eyeballing it it ha been better than the rpi at measuring good versus bad team the espn tournament analyst joe lunardi said of the netmore subtle but at least a important moving from rpi to net even the acronym seems an improvement may have heralded a shift in the selection committee philosophical underpinnings the selection committee for the division i woman tournament will still use the rpievery year there is a long loud debate when it come to selecting the atlarge bid the team that do not receive automatic tournament slot by virtue of winning their conference tournament championship the fundamental question is in sifting the candidate should the committee pick on the basis of who is most deserving which is to say the team that had the better season to that point or simply pick the best which is to say the team that gave other indication of overall qualityrpi which essentially measured only wonlost record and strength of schedule wa a tool for most deserving net which combine those rpilike input with efficiency rating and margin of victory is an argument for bestjoel sokol a georgia tech professor of engineering who compiles a college basketball rating known a lrmc noted that net ha more closely tracked other advanced rating including his own and kenpoms main rating which measure offensive and defensive efficiency per possession adjusted for opponent strengthits a lot better than the rpi a lot more reflective of how good the team are sokol saidstanfords muir who ha served for several year on the selection committee that pick and then seed the final ncaa men field of team this week called net contemporarywere quite pleased with how the new metric is working he said last month adding there a thousand possession that occur over the course of a year coming down to one possession is not going to adjust your net that significantlyby contrast the rpi really could be affected by a single possession it wa a goodfaith attempt to do two thing situate team record in the context of their strength of schedule and discourage team from running up the score but this meant that a single bad if close loss or good if close victory could disproportionately sway a team ratingand the rpis myopic focus encouraged team simply to schedule good opponent or have the good fortune shared only by majorconference team of facing many good opponent in league play worse by not accounting for homecourt advantage in a sport in which the home team win nearly two in three game rpi boosted team that could afford to schedule more nonconference home game which again tended to be majorconference teamsdepending upon the amount of money and support you have and your arena you can basically isolate yourself from the rest of the world or at least control who you play and when you play them and where you play them said doug fullerton who served on the selection committee when he wa big sky conference commissioner it a have and havenot situationmeanwhile discouraging blowout meant ignoring margin of victory which sport analyst for decade have generally said is a better predictor of future winning percentagewhen you played a good team you didnt get a bonus for winning by than winning by sokol said he noted that kansa ha an unlikely record in onepossession and overtime game this season further explaining it aberrantly high rpiby contrast net factor game location into it team value index and the ncaa also sort win into quadrant based on whether they came at home on the road or at a neutral court and net account for margin of victory although in a nod to sportsmanship the stat is capped at pointsi think thats an honest attempt to try to capture what a point spread would tell you without creating an incentive for someone to run the score up fullerton saidto see the kind of team net favor over rpi and vice versa consider two bubble squad north carolina state and arizona statedespite playing in the competitive atlantic coast conference the wolfpack had a dreadful rpi of rd thanks to a schedule rated thmost difficult according to friday realtimerpi figure that is partly the result of a conference slate featuring only four game against the acc top three team duke virginia and north carolina and a nonconference schedule that began with five homecourt gimmes yet with close road loss to the future low seed wisconsin and florida state a well a win over the likely tournament team syracuse and auburn north carolina state net is an eminently respectable rdon the other hand arizona state is a classic good rpi team having defeated kansa and much of a middling but

rugged guard marcus smart dont help with the looming specter of irving free agency and a possible trade pursuit of davis adding to the tensionmilwaukee meanwhile ha the statistical profile of a team that should be heavily favored to represent the east in the final and potentially take down the warrior except for the fact that the next playoff series won by the otherworldly giannis antetokounmpo will be his first the buck are the only team in the league that ranked in the top five in offensive and defensive efficiency but i confess to being one of those oldschool pundit hung up on their lack of biggame experiencedenver is the west answer to milwaukee and proof a a no seed that there were some uplifting tale to celebrate amid all of the transactional chaos and personality conflict that tend to dominate the league slice of the social medium universe but the nugget own inexperience didnt just steer me away from naming them a the warrior top threat in the conference it make them vulnerable in round against san antonioits houston then which stand a the team most capable of derailing the warrior bid for a threepeat houston problem is that a costly slip to the no seed in the west dropped it into golden state half of the playoff bracket the rocket now must face the utah jazz in a firstround matchup featuring the hottest houston went and thirdhottest utah went team since the allstar breakfor all the talk that the rocket may benefit from a rematch with the warrior in the conference semifinal rather than the west final when james harden and chris paul are theoretically fresher it may actually be golden state that benefit the most from watching houston and utah beating each other up so earlythe warrior wont refuse the help either because their veteran and coach would undoubtedly argue that their regularseason grind is longer than anyones after four consecutive trip to the championship round ceaseless speculation about durant potential freeagent defection to the knicks or the net yes im indeed warning you now not to sleep on brooklyn ha only added to coach steve kerrs daily challenge to keep his team focusedanother warning dont forget that the warrior tend to

even though we havent been winning game whatever lineup weve been putting out there theyre giving what they have so thats the no thingas for james these are his first truly inconsequential game since his rookie season with the cleveland cavalier who finished well out of playoff contention but even then he could use the end of the season a an opportunity to hone his ability and gain experience for future endeavor such a eight consecutive trip to the nba finalsso it is a credit to james even a the grease fire of his first season with the lakers smolder that he is out there trying against the king he finished with his st career tripledouble point assist rebound how doe he sustain the motivationif he out there on the court he going to give what he ha walton said thats probably a better

would greet the unquestioned lord of the eastern conference if he dared to defect sign with the los angeles lakers if you wish for the sunnier hollywood life and all the perk but brace yourself for the most trying regular season of your career if you decide to go west that wa the gist of the scouting report which in retrospect could not have been much more prescient on cue the most daunting and yes disappointing season of james career is right here right now for the biggest name in basketballand it appears he will soon have to stomach that it going on his ledger in the most permanent ink that he wa unable to bring a halt to the longest postseason drought in lakers history barring an unforeseen resurrection from a fractured group that sits four and a half game out of a western

eighth consecutive final appearance actually missing out on the nba postseason for the first time since his second professional season in when he wa just even though he can rightly point to his recent groin strain a the biggest standingsaltering disruption these lakers have endured james surely understands that his maiden campaign in los angeles is bound to be recorded in many precinct a a failure

remaining schedule according to tankathoncom well never know if the lakers who had risen to a heady fourth in the west at when james sustained the groin injury in a christmas day rout of golden state could have kept building upon that promising start with a healthy lebron but we most certainly do know that james mere return to the lineup at wasnt enough to rescue a roster that ha been assailed since conception for it lack of perimeter shooting and it defensive deficiency nor ha he been able to galvanize a locker room that wa deeply destabilized by the lakers trade pursuit of the new orleans superstar anthony davis which became allconsuming in late january and ha never recovered it obviously doesnt help that james after missing two key free throw in the final minute saturday is also converting a substandard percent of his attempt from the line to give his critic more handy fodderleaving his homestate cleveland cavalier for the lakers last july without the accompaniment of a second superstar meant that james in a far deeper conference would have little margin for error just to reach the playoff when you combine james injury absence with the continuing postdavis malaise and the team declining ball movement since lonzo ball ankle wa sidelined six week ago it add up rather quickly to a margin that is long gonethe call for walton dismissal a they were in january remain nonsensical a coaching change now much like new orleans decision to fire general manager dell demps shortly after the trade deadline would have no discernible effect on the lakers shortterm prospect beyond providing their frustrated fan with a see we did something sacrificethe prevailing assumption in league coaching circle remains that walton will almost certainly be dismissed after the season

williamson a preternatural talent and the unique way that they limit the income of a unique playerif the nba did not bar high schoolers from heading straight to the league a rule that may disappear in a few year then williamson could already have been playing for say the atlanta hawk and making several million dollar on his rookie contract if ncaa rule did not prevent player from signing endorsement williamson could already have been receiving million from nikehowever barring an outright catastrophe williamson the likely top draft pick will be getting paid soon and well and at a time when his economic productivity is even higher than it is today his specialness though obscures what some suggest is the greatest injustice of college sport policy of amateurismin contrast to williamson and a few other superstar most player in college basketball are denied the right to cash in during what is very likely their moment of peak economic valuethe top guy are worth a lot on the order of million a year said daniel rascher a sport economist who ha studied the economic value of college athlete but the seven eight nine guy he added referring to the player further down the depth chart are going to be several hundred thousand a year in term of the incremental revenue they bring to the schooltake duke jordan goldwire he wa a midrated recruit out of high school and his option besides duke included midmajor program such a eastern kentucky coastal carolina and nevadalas vega he is probably not bound for nba rich this season he ha not played at all in three acc game and ha averaged fewer than seven minute in those he ha played in he played eight minute against the tar heel on wednesday but that actually made him an essential contributor to a twohour broadcast worth a lot of money to duke the acc and espnif you look at the nba the guy who dont play very much still get paid a lot rascher saidor forget about duke and think of the player at whichever team make the ncaa tournament out of the big south or the patriot league part of that billiondollar event charm come from the quirky matchup and the potential for exciting upset when such team face juggernaut like duke and kansa in the early round player on those team too are producing a real financial return for the ncaa for it member college and for cbs and turner sport even though their ability will never be remotely so lucrative again yet they are prohibited from taking more than a relatively small prescribed share of that valuemoreover all of these player too are risking future in professional basketball more of them than you might think while fewer than percent of division i men basketball player are drafted into the nba the ncaa said last year around half go on to play pro basketball in some form such a in foreign league from team in the five top conference the ncaa added more than threequarters of player go on to be paid to playthe college sport establishment common rebuttal to these line of thinking is that not paying the player beyond scholarship and related cost is actually crucial to the popularity of their sportslast year in a federal lawsuit challenging the ncaas restriction on compensation from an antitrust perspective mike aresco a former sport television executive who is now commissioner of the american athletic conference testified that college player amateur status wa a feature of their sport appeal not a bugit resonated with fan because it wasnt professionalized at all he said according to a court transcript while serving a a witness for several conference and the ncaa itself and it wa presented and framed a college student a college sportsamong other thing this distinction differentiated college basketball and college football from minor league sport aresco said and that wa very important he added because minor league had never been popularhe said people view college sport separately and we always maintained that separationrascher wa a witness for the plaintiff in that case in which a decision is expected any day his reply to argument like arescos wa to point to the experiment of sort that took place a few year ago when the ncaa permitted college to offer athlete fund that included the socalled full cost of attendance after player began to be paid slightly more than they had previously been college sport popularity wa not measurably affectedwilliamsons injury in the marquee game of the regular season particularly so early in the contest appeared to be a devastating blow to duke which entered a a point favorite yet

angeles lakers and james wa a few month from dragging the cleveland cavalier to another appearance in the nba final kuzma had reached out by phone hoping for some tipsjust wanted to see how one of the great take care of his body and ha so much longevity kuzma recalled this week in an interview everybody want to play basketball for a long a possibleso much ha changed since that initial conversation kuzma and james are teammate now and kuzma is experiencing the unique challenge that come with playing alongside one of the game behemoth at the same time james body finally betrayed him this season which ha only heightened the sense of urgency within the organization the lakers who have missed the playoff for five year running are not in position for a patient rebuildjames at may still be in his prime but the stake are already high for a franchise that desperately want to maximize his time in los angeles and while neither james nor lakers management ha shown much enthusiasm for coaxing along a young core the lakers tried to ship half the roster to new orleans last week they are stuck in this together james wa supposed to be the savior of a flagship franchise gone astray salvaging the final month of this year would be a key indicator that he still wields that type of powerwe have to approach the rest of the season just like you would during the playoff kuzma saida kuzma recalled his talk with james he had no way of knowing that the lakers were mere hour from suffering one final implosion before the nba allstar break a loss to the atlanta hawk that left the team with a losing record and ample opportunity for soul searchingits time for u to get away and reflect a little bit about where we are a a group coach luke walton said i think this first part of the season weve gone through a lot of adversity and were probably not where we want to be but were still close enoughclose enough that is for vying for a spot in the playoff which wa both an indication of the team modest goal and it sad reality at the lakers are in th place in the western conference standing it is unfamiliar territory for james who ha not been on a losing team this late in a season since he wa a firstyear forward with the cavaliersbut with lebron on your team anything is possible said mychal thompson a power forward for the showtimeera lakers and an analyst for the team radio broadcast i mean look at some of the team he taken to the final including last season he capable of doing great thing if you just get on board and run with himthe lakers though seem fragile after nearly five month of drama all of it stemming directly or indirectly from the million deal that james signed to join the team last summer the pressure wa on from the start and little ha gone according to plantheres been more noise this year walton said but that wa to be expected with the move in the offseason that wa something to be anticipatedwhere to begin brandon ingram and rajon rondo were suspended for trying to brawl with the houston rocket two game into the season magic johnson the team outspoken president of basketball operation chastised walton in a closeddoor meeting for the team slow start igniting lasting question about walton job security nearly every player on the roster ha been injured and that includes james who missed game with a strained groinand lest we forget last week johnson and general manager rob pelinka tried to trade away nearly half the roster to the new orleans pelican for anthony davis who before the start of the season hired the same agent who represents james it wa the clearest sign yet that johnson is willing to attempt the very boldest move no matter the residual damageconsider that the lakers amid their ultimately fruitless effort to pry davis away from the pelican lost by point to the indiana pacer and with rumor of which lakers would be traded swirling through social medium it wa difficult to find argument in their defense even from james himselfkuzma who wa offered up a one of the piece in a potential deal said it had been difficult to drown out the noiseits definitely tough he said because this generation youre always on your phone always on social medium always seeing it somewhere on tvbut the trade deadline passed and the roster more or le remained intact there had been a sense that a surprising win against the boston celtic on feb would galvanize the team in the wake of so much uncertainty and even after losing to the philadelphia er three day later the lakers still had a chance to build some momentum against the hawk on tuesdaybefore the game james appeared to be in an upbeat mood in the locker room he knelt on a giant inflatable ball a he worked on some corestrengthening exercise he crooned the lyric to plug walk by the hiphop artist rich the kid he made small talk with ingram it wa all vintage jamesabout three hour later once the lakers had punctuated their loss with a turnover james made a beeline off the court and into the tunnel he wa practically steaming he had finished with his fifth tripledouble of the season point assist rebound but the lakers defense wa a porous a a coffee filter and the result wa just a messyi can throw that game in the trash james saidin a threeminute postgame session with reporter kuzma mentioned the concept of fun five time specifically the notion that the lakers were not having much of ita lot of time were out there with sad face very focused face kuzma said but i think were at our best when were having funfun may not be the primary objective for james and the psychic effect of the loss are sure to linger until at least feb when their season will resume after the allstar break with a home game against the houston rocket for now though the best thing for these player may be to be away from each other for a while which wa one of walton suggestion before they parted for the breakspend some time by yourself he said and added i think weve got a group that will be ready by the time we get backadvertisement

specialtyi still have a lot of work to do knox saidand so do the knicks who arrived to face the los angeles lakers at staple center on friday night having lost eight straightbut then another flicker

little for such technicality james l dolan the team owner wa in town for the game and visited the locker room afterward to congratulate the teamwhen we win we celebrate like it the super bowl fizdale said why notthe knicks were right to savor the win who know when the next one will come they still need to visit the portland trail blazer and the golden state warrior before returning to new york on friday and one game will neither change the trajectory of their season nor mask their daily challengesbut it wa important in it own waywell try to run with the momentum tim hardaway jr saidthe knicks have an odd roster made up of veteran on expiring contract and inexperienced player who are still learning the business of pro basketball and that mix which is almost a split ha caused some problem fizdale said not among player in the locker room they like each other he said but in term of the team oncourt chemistrybefore the knicks arrived in los angeles the first half of their road trip featured a point loss to the milwaukee buck a point loss to the utah jazz and a point loss to the denver nuggetswe are so young and we have so many guy in contract year fighting for their life that ive got to get this group to move the ball fizdale said the number say that when we pas the ball we win and when we dont pas we losehe went on to acknowledge the inevitable friction between player who are vying for their next deal and may feel more urgency to produce and those who have the luxury of being included in the team longterm plan for the most part fizdale ha been favoring the young player with promisethats just part of this league and thats the juggling act that i have to handle fizdale said am i always going to be right no but will i always be upfront and honest about where we are and what were doing yesenes kanter one of the aforementioned veteran who will be a free agent this summer ha gone public with his displeasure over his diminished role kanter got an opportunity off the bench against the lakers and delivered finishing with point and reboundsi dont want no free money kanter said this organization pay me money to go out and play a hard a i can and just fight so im going to give my everythingkanter though is not the only one to voice frustration hardaway who figure to be a part of the team future ha alluded to the toll of losing to the thankless process of a perpetual rebuild he doe not subscribe to the idea that the knicks should be tanking game to increase their odds of getting the top pick in the draft lotteryim a competitor hardaway said none of u got here by losing ballgame for our respective ball club when we were in college or in high school everybody wa winner everybody wanted to win just to be in this situation is tough but it build characterone of the bright spot ha been the improved play of knox who averaged point and rebound while shooting percent from point range during decemberagainst the lakers knox made backtoback pointer early in the first quarter then sliced through the lane for a dunk and a point lead the game wa barely six minute old james in a dark blazer watched with a dour expression from behind the home bench he is expected to miss at least another week because of a groin injury the knicks after giving up their lead held on late thanks to some solid defenseknox finished with point in minute which is the sort of workload to which he is becoming accustomedwe talked about building him into a premier nba player who can play both end of the floor fizdale said and were trying to give him a taste of what that entail it not necessarily the minute you play but what youre doing with those minute from an effort standpoint from a competitive standpoint how many calorie are you burningfor one night the burn

advertisementsupported byon pro basketballby scott cacciolalos angeles the evolution of giannis antetokounmpo into a global star ha been playing out for six season it manifest in soaring dunk or blocked shot from the weak side that defy logic or wraparound pass to an open shooter or crossover dribble that leave defender reeling in his impossibly longlimbed wakebut pat connaughton a reserve guard did not have the opportunity to witness antetokounmpos feat on a daily basis until last summer when he signed with the milwaukee buck and joined his new teammate for scrimmage ahead of training campyoud see him do something ridiculous and id be looking around and nobody would be reacting connaughton recalled like did you guy not just see thatfor the player who have been around antetokounmpo the longest there may be an element of genius fatigue at work not that they take him for granted malcolm brogdon a thirdyear guard tried to provide some context for connaughton at one of those early scrimmagesyoull get used to it after a while brogdon told him it happens all the timeantetokounmpo ha turned the sublime into the routine but the novelty ha not worn off for nba fan who have made him appointment viewing this season and the buck have shaped themselves into contender by following his lead on top of that nearly two year after kobe bryant the retired los angeles lakers guard challenged antetokounmpo to win the league most valuable player award he may be on the verge of upending the eastern conference to do soeverything you see about him or hear about him is how hard he work lakers coach luke walton said and how great he want to bethe buck improved their leaguebest record to after coming from behind to defeat the lakers on friday night at staple center antetokounmpo who ha been dealing with right knee soreness finished with point and rebound in the buck win which qualified a a quiet effort for him but he had his momentsearly in the fourth quarter he sized up mike muscala his foot defender at the top of the perimeter he took a couple of hard dribble into the paint threw his right shoulder into muscala to knock him off balance then dunked over him with his left handhe draw so much attention buck coach mike budenholzer saidit wa a play that helped ignite the buck who enjoyed an eventful day after point guard eric bledsoe agreed to a fouryear million contract extension in the afternoon he roasted the lakers for a seasonhigh point in addition pau gasol wa expected to join the team after securing a buyout from the san antonio spursunbelievable guy antetokounmpo said of gasol he been to the final he ha so much experience i think he definitely going to help usthe buck are readying for a playoff run with antetokounmpo a their focal point entering their game against the utah jazz on saturday night antetokounmpo wa averaging point rebound and assist while shooting percent from the fieldwhen the season started we knew we had something special we had a great team he said but to be honest with you no i never thought we were going to have the best record in the nbabut i think weve worked hard for it we go out there and show up for every game and we try to win every gamethere is no apt historical comparison for antetokounmpo because the league ha never seen anyone quite like him he is too long and too strong too quick and too skilled a foot power forward who can defend point guard at one end and post up the league stoutest center at the other a for antetokounmpos unique athleticism connaughton considers him to be something of a hybrid of kevin durant of the golden state warrior and lebron james of the lakershes got the length of kd connaughton said but now he at the point where he got the strength of lebron or at least he on that trajectory and that speaks volume about his work ethic and his desire to be the best that he can be because not a lot of guy with that talent work that hardconnaughton whose playing time ha fluctuated this season often go to the team practice facility on off day for extra shooting and conditioning work antetokounmpo connaughton said is always there too he is a gym rat in the second year of a fouryear million contract connaughton joined the buck after three season with the portland trail blazer and he said antetokounmpo play with the same motor the same mindset a damian lillard the blazer allstar point guardobviously dame is a different player but i think they share an inner desire connaughton said it ha nothing to do with the outside it ha nothing to do with the medium the attention or the press like theyre in it for their own reason the right reason in my opinionwhenever budenholzer is asked about it which is often these day he make a compelling case for antetokounmpo a the nbas most valuable player and he cite his defense a exhibit a antetokounmpo is so dynamic on offense budenholzer said that it tends to overshadow everything else is doe sure enough he had three blocked shot against the lakersantetokounmpo is not going to create headline with bold prediction after friday win he repeated familiar mantra about taking it day by day and continuing to work hard but the buck must be thinking big all around them powerhouse team are struggling even the warrior the twotime defending champion have had issuesfew thought the buck would be this good this quickly but

advertisementsupported byon college basketballby marc tracyminneapolis this final four is the fifth anniversary of one of the most effective if inadvertent instance of athlete activism in college sportsthis wa when the connecticut star shabazz napier speaking to the news medium shortly before the national championship game said that he sometimes did not have enough to eatthere are hungry night that i go to bed and im starving he saidwithin week the ncaas board of director for division i voted to lift restriction on how much team could feed their player no longer would there be bizarre hairsplitting over what wa and wa not a meal notoriously serving peanut did not count while serving peanut butter did now team can and do routinely give athlete feaststhis commonsense reform had been in the work and probably would have occurred eventually but the stark comment by a highprofile player at the ncaas signature event ensured the nearly immediate change and boatload of attention on the ncaas power over college athletesit is fruitful to remember the efficacy of napier comment because we are at a moment when it appears that further reform to college sport muchmaligned policy of amateurism will come only from within the player will have the foremost and maybe even exclusive power to agitate for changewhat would have happened if zion williamson had said after his nike shoe exploded jeopardizing his career that enough wa enough that he no longer would wear a shoe for nothing while his coach wa at least indirectly paid million by nike and that no other player should put up with this hypocrisy eitherthe power is with labor and the player said kain colter the former northwestern quarterback who led a unionization drive among his teammate several year agothis wa most obviously displayed in when missouri football player threatened to sit out a game unless the university president stepped down or wa fired he stepped down that the boycott concerned the campus racial climate rather than the player compensation ought not conceal the reality of what happened the player unpaid ununionized flexed their muscle and the system gave investing power in athlete to reform sport is not historically aberrant from jackie robinson withstanding taunt threat and worse to break major league baseball color line to baseball player striking in the s and s to gain and keep fullfledged free agency to the track standout edwin moses devising benefit for olympic athlete athlete have often been the one bringing about change their leverage is unmatched they are the one the fan pay to see and therefore the one who ultimately have the power over profitand they are the only one with a steady interest in well their own interestconsider what else ha happened since napier commentscolters unionization effort which a national labor relation board regional director endorsed week before napier final four wa squashed by the overall boardthe antitrust lawsuit that might have allowed player to profit off the use of their likeness in video game and other medium ended in an extremely limited victory for playerslast month a second antitrust suit which sought to explode the ncaas ban on compensation concluded at the districtcourt level with a technical victory for player that looked a much like a victory for the establishment a federal judge ruled that the ncaa could continue to limit payment to player that were not directly related to educationthe court are not a forum where youre going to get relief said don yee a sport lawyer and playersrights advocatefor yee who also happens to be tom brady agent the solution is private entrepreneurialism he is planning a small professional football league that would field player not yet eligible for the nfl which generally requires player to be three year removed from high school it would be developmental like college football but unlike college football average pay would be a planned summer basketball league the historical basketball league would pay scholarship for it collegelevel player while enabling them to sell their name image and likeness to sponsor the nbas development league plan to offer higher salary the probable dissolution of the oneanddone rule in the next few year will again permit the most talented high school graduate to jump straight to the nba instead of having to spend at least a year in collegea few state notably north carolina and california have bill floating around that would allow athlete to be paid if say a video game us their name and likenessesall these effort are well intentioned but if past is prologue the system will not be successfully reformed in such patchwork fashionnor is the college sport establishment likely to change it mind of it own volitionat a news conference in minneapolis last week the ncaa president mark emmert said that he had sought to increase athlete participation in college sport governanceim a lifelong academic he said i grew up with that tradition and i never worked at a school that didnt have student on their board and they were full voting board member they voted on my contract and i think thats just perfectly appropriatethere are athlete serving on several important council but there is not one on the ncaa board of governor no athlete vote on emmerts contract which wa extended late last year through tim nevius a onetime ncaa investigator whose experience led him to turn on the system belief the answer lie with player activism last month he announced a new organization the college athlete advocacy initiative that plan to pair his business representing athlete before the ncaa with trying to advocate for broader reform in coordination with playershe acknowledged in an interview the challenge including the relatively short time span that college athlete actually are college athlete a well a their current lack of formal bargaining power but he insisted that player action wa the surest avenue to changethere are power here that the athlete have he said and we have to simply have them realize it and help them take the power into their own handsros goldunwude a turner sport analyst and former stanford basketball player said last month that she expected to hear more from college athlete about how they felt about their position in the pecking orderthats the way our culture is where we all are telling our story on social medium platform she saidif youre really struggling or hungry she added that experience will come outapathy will come out a well though beyond the structural obstacle to athlete deciding the system is unfair and determining to act to change it a player could validly decide that he is happy receiving what he currently getsnapier who is now a reserve on the net and who through a spokesman declined to comment for this article said more during his hungry night speech heard round the world even though it received le publicityhe noted that there were other wrong player jersey

teammate who did not even play a teammate in fact who ha yet to log a single minute this season but is nearing his muchanticipated debuthopefully green said it devastating for everybody elselet that soak in for a second the warrior who have won three of the last four nba championship are already good at basketball all they did on tuesday wa set an nba record by scoring point in the first quarter the first quarter against a team that came into the game with the best record in the western conferencebut now after signing demarcus cousin over the summer and spending recent month incorporating him into their dynastic fold a he recovered from achilles tendon surgery the warrior expect him to be in their starting lineup when they visit the los angeles clipper on friday night it is a grand experiment that will play out over the second half of the seasonmore than anything were just excited for demarcus coach steve kerr said late tuesday night adding it going to take him some time to get his rhythmcousins a yearold center and a fourtime allstar ha not played since jan when he tore his left achilles in a game for the new orleans pelican at the time cousin wa having a career season with average of point rebound and assist a game he wa also due for free agency and an enormous paydaybut his type of injury ha ended career particularly among big men and every team in the league balked at offering him a longterm deal he wound up with the warrior who signed him to a oneyear contract worth million a modest price for a reclamation project with upside and little obvious riskits a relief cousin told reporter last week it been a long year for me a lot of ups and down but the finish line is aheadthere is no way of knowing if cousin who is listed at foot and pound will ever be the toptier player he once wa but the warrior neither need nor expect him to be a focal point of their offense and if he merely command attention from defender especially in the post he should free up additional space on the perimeter for the team cavalcade of shooterswe havent had a player like him before so it will be new kerr said it wont be a simple plug him in and hell fit right in well play through him some so there will be a period where we have to adapt fortunately were halfway through the year we have a lot of game to figure this outsince the warrior began collecting championship under kerr in they have had a rotating cast of dependable but unspectacular center andrew bogut festus ezeli zaza pachulia javale mcgee cousin ha never been a role player though he acknowledged his new and unfamiliar place in the warrior ecosystemwell he said i wont be taking a many shot a i have in the pasthe also ha a reputation for being emotional and something of an antagonist some of the warrior have firsthand experience kerr recalled getting ejected after arguing with the official in a game against the sacramento king in back when cousin wa playing for them but before he left the court kerr caught cousin taunting him by waving goodbyethen there wa an episode last season when cousin wa playing for the pelican and he got into an altercation with kevin durant after both player were ejected cousin tried to track down durant outside the warrior locker room and not to exchange pleasantriesit show that you care cousin said of playing with passion it show that it mean something to you im not really fan of the guy who are emotionless on the floornuggets coach mike malone who briefly coached cousin in sacramento said he enjoyed the experiencei loved coaching him malone said i think he a player thats misunderstood and when you have a chance to know him you realize who he is a a player and a a person and when he healthy he one of the more unstoppable big men in the nbamalone compared cousin to nikola jokic the nugget fourthyear center and an emerging multidimensional forcehe can score inside and he can score outside malone said of cousin he can handle the ball and he can make his teammate bettermalone said he expected that cousin would give the warrior a big lift and malone made those remark before the nugget loss to the warriorsthe warrior have had their struggle this season although these thing tend to be relative green beefed with durant stephen curry missed game with a strained groin klay thompson labored through an earlyseason shooting slump that he refused to acknowledge a an earlyseason shooting slump and they have lost more game than they usually dothe warrior have been rolling of late though winning seven of their last eight before their game against the pelican on wednesday night they appear to be playing their best basketball of the season a evidenced by their demolition of the nugget a rout so thorough that malone said it would be impossible for his team to just flush the loss and forget itbut now a the warrior get ready to introduce cousin to their explosive mix there are question can he play with pace can he acclimate himself to a supporting role can he defend quicker player if opponent go small against him and most important can he stay healthy and find his old form ahead of the playoffsthe warrior are eager to find

lebron james manning the center position the lakers already generate the thirdhighest pace in the league using a traditional lineup so imagine the possibilitiesthat smallball lineup is going to be huge for u kuzma told reporter on wednesday morning especially in the playoff when everybodys going to be going smallkuzma a secondyear forward wa making two assumption first that the lakers would make the playoff and second that they would have enough time to experiment with the lineup and refine it ahead of a hypothetical trip to the postseason not to stamp all over kuzmas enthusiasm but neither of those is a guarantee given the way the lakers hodgepodge season ha gonecoach luke walton to his credit is taking a more pragmatic approach though he entered the season hoping to unleash a smaller lineup that could cause mismatch problem the lakers do not have time to mess around with experiment he said not right now not after their recent struggle not with their continuing rash of injury and absencesits going to get tougher to do walton said adding a the season get further and further down the road those hey let try this during the game it going to be le and le because were in a pretty nasty fight for who get in and who not in so it will be more about what were good at and try to get better and better at thatevery team cope with injury of varying magnitude and the lakers

important caveat the piston who have lost of their last game are not playing stellar basketball but the lebronfree lakers are beginning to look more cohesive and more confident than they did in the day after they lost him to his injury on dec they have won two straight with james return date still uncertainafter the lakers medical staff evaluated james on thursday the team announced in a statement that he wa progressing and had been cleared to increase oncourt functional basketball movement he is scheduled to be reevaluated next wednesday but in the meantime the lakers will play on without him starting friday against the utah jazzjamess absence however long it last may not wind up being the worst thing for the lakers his workload over the past decadeplus ha been immense with most of his season extending through the nba final he just turned assuming he return at full strength without complication james could probably benefit from a midseason breakmore important perhaps ha been the opportunity for the team lesser light to operate on their own the training wheel are off for a while it looked bleak the lakers lost five of their first six game without james and it got bad enough that kobe bryant logged on to twitter to defend walton from an angry mobrelax bryant one the franchise most iconic figure wrote in a post on his account entire squad is damn near outat the time the lakers were without james kuzma and rajon rondo rondo could miss another two to three week after undergoing surgery on his right hand for the second time this season but kuzma who wa sidelined for two game with a back contusion ha since returnedon monday with the rust from his injury still apparent kuzma shot of from the field in a win against the dallas maverick on tuesday an off day for the lakers he went to the practice facility and took shot walton said on wednesday kuzma scored a careerhigh point in minute while shooting of from the fieldif you would have told me two year ago when i wa in college that i would score for the lakers i probably wouldnt have believed you kuzma said kind of crazybut this is his reality at age and walton said he wa also pleased with the aggressive play of lonzo ball and brandon ingram who are both they are learning a they go and their curriculum ha been more advanced in recent daysat the same time the lakers have emerged a a surprisingly respectable defensive team entering thursday they ranked eighth in the league in overall defensive ratingasked what he knew about his team at this stage of the season walton said we know that when were at our best were a really good team we know that were a team that can hang our hat on playing defense and getting stop were good when we get out and run lebron james is really goodbut really walton said there are probably more unknown than knowns with this group on only a handful of occasion ha he had close to a full roster at his disposal the rest of the league will be interested to see what the

and that team ha done everything several time overhe wa referring to the golden state warrior a superstar collective that ha demolished it share of opponent in recent year but what the warrior did to the nugget one night last week wa particularly gruesome in part because denver had entered the game with a slim lead over golden state in the nbas western conference standingsbut then on jan in front of a briefly enthusiastic crowd here the warrior scored point in the first quarter and sailed to a victory that sent a message to everyone on the opposing bench inside the building and across the league we are not going anywhereit wa for one night at least illustrative of the gulf that still exists between the warrior and the rest of the nba while golden state dominance had led many to despair

very similar i do think this team is a lot more talented than that team but that team used every inch of talent and every inch of ability to get thing doneleft unsaid the nugget are not using every inch of their talent not yet anyway in the jargon of the game they have untapped potential and this is understandable the nugget are a inexperienced a they are precocious seven of the team top player right now are or younger and that doe not even include michael porter jr a yearold forward and the th pick of the draft who is not expected to play this season after undergoing back surgerycoach michael malone ha consistently praised his player work ethic effort he said is not a problem but he doe want them to be more diligent about their mental preparationknow who the hell youre guarding malone said adding i think the guy on our roster most team probably have this issue where they show up to the game like who are we playing tonight and they havent done their work which to me is like a cardinal sin so we have to do a better job of understanding who am i playing what are his tendency and how can i take those awayin the locker room before the bull game malone reiterated how much work his staff put into scouting report before asking his player what they planned to offer that night in return jokic malone later recalled told him he would be aggressive murray said he would play hard a far a pregame chalk talk go it wa boilerplate stuff but the conversation had added import given the event of the weekthis is part of our journey malone saidmalone got a keener sense of that process from to a an assistant with the warrior under mark jackson when stephen curry and klay thompson were young player learning how to be pro the warrior went in a lockoutshortened season but by the season curry and thompson were forming winning habit malone recalled a sevengame road trip when the warrior went with their only loss coming against the orlando magic after the team spent an extra night in miami and perhaps that wa no coincidence but the trip wa otherwise an unqualified successi think thats when we a a team and a an organization said man we have a chance to be pretty good he saidthe nugget have had moment like that this season beating the raptor in toronto on dec wa a big deal but they still have a lot of work ahead malone saidwere a young team that is trying to become a playoff team and once you become a playoff team you hope to become a championship team malone said you cant skip stepssince malone wa hired by the nugget in they have improved each season from win in to win in to win last season when they narrowly missed the playoff malone signed a twoyear extension over the summer and the nugget are now on a pace to win game their last playoff appearance came in no le an eminence than kevin durant who to be fair joined the warrior a year after they had won their first championship of the currythompson era praised the nugget organizationcontinuity durant said you dont fire your coach after a losing season youre patient with him youre patient with your young player you let them make mistake let them growin the wake of denver loss to the warrior last week malone wa pleased to see a renewed commitment to defense in win over the bull and the cleveland cavalier it wa already clear that the team loss to golden state had been something of a formative experienceit

advertisementsupported byon college basketballby marc tracyif the opinion published friday night in a landmark college sport antitrust case were a novel then it villain would be the ncaain a novellalength page opinion united state district court judge claudia wilken criticizes berates even mock the ncaa for it refusal to allow college to compensate player for their valuable labor beyond a scholarship and related cost of attendance all in the name of something they call amateurismdefendants nowhere define the nature of the amateurism they claim consumer insist upon said wilken referring to the ncaa and several of it richest most prominent conferenceseven if they had wilken continued she pointed to numerous exception when player could effectively be paid player are paid beyond scholarship all the time in untold million of dollar invested in training facility in gift for participating in bowl game in fund available to purchase lossofvalue insurancethe rule that permit limit or forbid studentathlete compensation and benefit do not follow any coherent definition of amateurism she saidthe decision stem from a longrunning case in which a group of college athlete sued the ncaa and athletic conference that participate in the top level of basketball and football they contended that the ruling body of college sport had colluded to enact a system that unfairly limit the compensation they receive when they are attending and competing for their university the ncaa and the conference argue that those limit are essential for promoting amateurism and enhancing the value of college sport and undergraduate educationin her decision wilken seems to say that those rule did restrain trade producing significant anticompetitive effectsthe clerk wilken added on the final page with the majestic understatement of a good literary denouement shall enter judgment for the plaintiff classso why doesnt it feel a if the group of athlete who pursued the litigation to end the ncaas rule won the case why did they and their star sport labor lawyer jeffrey kessler not get the outcome they most fervently soughtdespite finding that the ncaa wa violating federal law wilken turned away the plaintiff main proposed remedy which wa also the logical one to lift the supposedly lawbreaking cap on compensation that mean the continuation of a status quo where so many player feel they are working basically for free hows thatwhen you apply a uniquely muddled set of law to a unique industry this is the kind of ruling you get said gabe feldman who directs tulanes sport law program and teach antitrust law the unique muddle to which he wa referringthe upshot of friday ruling pending a likely appeal is that the ncaa may continue to cap payment to athlete after all with the limited exception of expense that are educational in nature think computer or cost related to internship or postgraduate scholarshipsdont think stipend of or or because the player receiving it is good enough that he or she is worth even more than that to the college in increased ticket sale and medium exposure and television right paymentsno wonder several of the defendant responded this weekend with the kind of equanimity one doe not expect from party that technically lost a casethe decision reaffirms the fundamental principle of the collegiate athletic model and of amateurism pacific commissioner larry scott said in a statement studentathletes are first and foremost student who attend college to receive an education and to prepare themselves for success in life while also pursuing athletic excellencescotts statement is more aspirational than descriptive there are basketball player who conclude their college career before finishing even a year of collegesimilarly the reaction from playersrights advocate wa more muted than you might expect postvictorythis is progress but it just one step ramogi huma of the college athlete player association said in a text message this ruling still treat athlete a secondclass citizen no other student or citizen is subject to such harmful economic pricefixing especially one imposed by a repeat antitrust violator that doe not have an antitrust exemptionhow can a judge rule that a law is being broken but allow the lawbreaking to continueaccording to feldman the answer includes a muchdisputed antitrust principle known a the rule of reason in some case including this one the rule call for anticompetitive activity to be overturned only if there is a different system that could provide the positive benefit of the anticompetitive system without suppressing other competition a muchwilken determined that amateurism wa crucial to college sport commercial appeal and allowed it to compete with professional sport even if doing so required it to apparently violate antitrust lawthe court doe credit the importance to consumer demand of maintaining a distinction between college sport and professional sport she saidcourts have given sport league a wide berth when it come to antitrust feldman said the argument is that sport are uniqueafter all sport can not really exist unless say team are allowed to agree to the same rule in men basketball even though that might technically constitute collusion in any other realm of commercewilken wa also following precedent most of all she wa following a precedent set by the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit her circuitin an earlier case known a obannon the appellate court agreed with part of a wilken finding at the district court level that the ncaa ban on compensating athlete for the commercial use of their name image and likeness in thing like video game wa an antitrust violation but the appellate judge overturned her proposal that athlete be able to receive up to annually in exchange the ninth circuit reasoning wa that such payment were not tethered to educationyou can draw a direct line between that phrase from and wilkens ruling in this case that is how she solomonically decided that the ncaa may restrict payment a long a they are noneducationalfuture plaintiff if they challenge ncaa rule will look for a jurisdiction outside of the ninth circuit feldman said the ninth circuit after all ha now made it very clear it will defer to the ncaaanother venue could rule in a more plaintifffriendly direction kessler the prominent sport lawyer may now be able to push forward with a nearly identical case in federal district court in new jerseyeither way the future of college athletics is now out of the hand of wilken who for nearly a decade ha loomed over ither decision last friday may be a result of her understanding her power and it limit numerous observer expected a more plaintifffriendly ruling based on the question she asked during

learning to defend grown men who know the trick of the trade he say he is learning to vary his pace when he come off the bench for the charlotte hornet because he doe not need to dial it up to flambé all the timeyou have to know when to speed up and when to slow down said monk a foot shooting guard and im still learningmonk did not anticipate that his first two season in the nba would be so challenging not after he wa the southeastern conference player of the year in his only season at kentucky and the th overall pick in the draft he is no le confident in his ability than he once wa but he is definitely le naïvei thought it would be way smoother he said in an interview on tuesday before the hornet played the clipper at staple center i thought i wa going to play right away when i first got here i thought i wa going to play right away this year too but it been a lot of ups and downshis growing pain are not unique to secondyear player but there may be more organizational urgency with monk given the hornet uncertain future walker their allstar point guard and the face of the franchise is due for unrestricted free agency this summer and he need more talent around him for the hornet to be a contender perhaps monk will be a part of that equation but the clock is ticking and it still requires some imagination to envision the player he could becomemonk though offer flash and some of them came against the clipper the second of game action he required to take and make his first pointer his running floater on the following possession even his pyrotechnic offense in garbage

while shooting percent from the field while he need to become a more proficient shooter he ha more pronounced limitation on defense where he is on the small side for a shooting guard and lack the savvy of many of the bigger more experienced player he is trying to defendman if youre a second late it over with monk said you can recover in college in college you can hide in a zone too but here you get exposed everybodys so goodat kentucky monk teamed up in the backcourt with deaaron fox another immensely talented freshman who declared for the draft fox went fifth to the sacramento king and

couple of other former teammate at kentucky monk said and they message one another all the time monk root for fox i tell him keep killing fox monk said but he can not help noting the opportunity that fox ha gotten and how much he ha made of itif you get down on yourself thats going to mess everything up monk said so i just try to stay positive you have to be patient man patienceborrego benched monk for two game last month the coach wa frustrated with the team defense but said on tuesday that he wa pleased with monk progresshes just got to be more consistent on the defensive end borrego said and were seeing that growthmonks minute though have been sporadic much a they were last season under steve clifford who now coach the orlando magic and he said he wa learning to adapt everyone want to start he said but maybe he wa meant to come off the bench and develop into an elite scorer like lou williams or jamal crawford two player who have turned their reserve role into art form or maybe monk said his career will take a different turnthere are always team watching monk said so i mean if this is not your spot it might be somewhere else and there always somebody watching and it probably somebody that like you so youve got to go out there and do stuff for you and for your team if you do both of those thing together youll be all rightasked if he wa happy in charlotte monk said im

advertisementsupported byon pro basketballby marc steinthe knicks sudden trade sending kristaps porzingis their franchise player to the dallas maverick last week ha raised a swirl of question about the team motivationsgood news we have answersporzingis wa abruptly dispatched to dallas last thursday along with tim hardaway jr courtney lee and trey burke for guard dennis smith jr two future firstround pick and the sizable expiring contract of deandre jordan and wes matthewslets dig into six of the biggest curiosity surrounding the departure of the knicks beloved no steve mill the knicks president cited worry that porzingis wa growing detached from the organization a a key factor in the team decision to seek out trade for the best big man it ha seen since patrick ewingit turn out that the knicks spent much of january quietly canvassing the league for potential porzingis deal according to a person familiar with the talk who wa not authorized to discus them publicly they tried unsuccessfully to trade for untouchable such a utah donovan mitchell and sacramento deaaron foxbut the knicks knew all along that the maverick had the wherewithal to meet many of their trade objective and just a crucially that dallas wa generally unfazed by the torn anterior cruciate ligament porzingis suffered last februaryin smith dallas had a recent top pick to offer the maverick also proved willing to give up two future firstround draft pick in a porzingis deal while absorbing the contract of hardaway and lee the knicks were able to shed both of those deal because dallas had two huge expiring contract to send back jordan and matthew and had long been fond of hardaway despite his defensive deficienciesperhaps you are a smith skeptic or just a knicks skeptic those are both understandable position but a trade that return three quality asset and will create the kind of salarycap space this summer that the knicks must have to chase kevin durant and kyrie irving in free agency is no salary dumpit is a gamble true but it is also an undeniable haulthe maverick interest in porzingis ha been an open secret to the knicks for year one maverick official estimated that dallas approached the knicks about a hundred time before the team ever showed any willingness to discus trading himthe knicks for their part had expressed interest in smith all season the team according to two people with knowledge of their talk also had been discussing a hardawayformatthews trade for week before jan which both side pinpoint a the first date the knicks were open to discussing a porzingis blockbusterthe party a a result did not need long to build a trade frameworkit certainly did not hurt that the maverick made their lone madison square garden appearance of the season two night later knicks general manager scott perry and his maverick counterpart donnie nelson met before the game in a garden hallway before taking their huddle behind closed door and summoning millsby night end smith had registered a tripledouble in a resounding dallas victory and the maverick were offering to seal the porzingis deal by handshake since mark cuban the dallas owner wa in the building the knicks however asked for more timethe reason porzingis and his brother janis the player agent had requested a thursday morning meetingwhen asked at a monday news conference to address his reported desire to be traded porzingis passedi would rather just focus on whats ahead of me than looking back porzingis saida person with knowledge of the meeting however said it wa requested by the porzingis brother after they had canceled a similar meeting earlier in january and that it lasted le than five minute later in the day according to the person janis porzingis gave the knicks a list of four team he and kristaps had deemed acceptable trade destinationsthe net and the los angeles clipper were among those four team but dallas wa not the knicks meanwhile were told porzingis wa prepared to leave the team and continue his knee rehabilitation in spain if he wa not moved by thursday pm trade deadlineit wa not long after receiving the fourteam list that the knicks notified the maverick they would do the dealthe knicks were convinced that no team besides dallas would take the hardaway and lee contract and package a player of smith caliber with firstround draft picksthe knicks also were fearful that letting the dallas offer linger or engaging other team in the week leading up to the trade deadline would enable the porzingis camp to scare off the maverick or other potential suitor by threatening to sign longterm only with team like the net or the clippersin a radio interview monday with fm in dallas cuban said shopping a deal is a lot more complicated than it soundsrisky a it would be given his uncertain health porzingis ha the option to play next season for a mere million and become an unrestricted free agent in july the knicks mounting fear that he would exercise that option or say he wa only willing to sign a oneyear deal with a player option in year are largely what convinced team official they had to pursue tradesbut the maverick are one of those dicerolling team like boston houston and most recently oklahoma city when it traded for paul george that bet on themselves in these situation dallas is already expressing confidence it can get porzingiss signature on a fiveyear million contract this summerporzingis ha preexisting relationship with dirk nowitzki and luka doncic the maverick rising star from slovenia and neither maverick coach rick carlisle nor cuban ha been bashful about comparing a doncicporzingis partnership to the nowitzkisteve nash duo that wa busted up after just six season nash wa allowed to sign with phoenix in july after which both nowitzki and nash won most valuable player honor separatelyit wa my mistake to not keep dirk and steve together longer cuban said monday night i wont make the same mistake with luka and kpit is simply not possible to answer this today not without knowing for starter how the knicks will fare in free agency and how porzingis will bounce back from his knee injurybut i can tell you this in my discussion with rival team executive i have heard from many more who praise the trade than those who question how much the knicks received in returnalso the threat of the knicks persuading durant to leave one of the most dominant team in league history based on the latest vibe emanating from the bay area ha never felt more real to the warrior themselvesthe knicks have received considerable criticism for smearing porzingis on his way out and let face it believeitwheniseeit scoffing at the notion that the game biggest name would be willing to play for the knicks when they are still owned and operated by james dolan is fully expected given how the last two decade have gone since the knicks trip to the nba final in yet there is far more to like than dislike about the deal even if porzingis becomes everything dallas dream he can be the knicks move forward with massive financial flexibility and a young core of smith kevin knox allonzo trier and frank ntilikina a well a seven firstround pick over the next five year chip they can either build around or offer in trade for someone starry like anthony davisprocessing all that should bring knicksloving new yorkers

in the nba felt a need to pause in admiration of what wa happeningso livingston stared out onto the floor at staple center and tried to process that demarcus cousin had indeed joined the starry quartet of stephen curry kevin durant klay thompson and draymond green to run through some defensive instruction a a unitim not going to lie livingston said i saw the five of them together and for a second i wa like wow thats a fantasy squad the rest of the warrior would go on to enjoy their own fantasybecomesreality moment friday night finally making his debut with the twotime reigning champion after nearly a year in injury exile cousin frankly looked a joyful a weve ever seen him in an nba game logging four effective stint for a total of minute second in a road rout of the los angeles clippersthere were a few awkward drive to the rim more than a few of his familiar grumble to the referee and six foul in those minute but cousin also racked up an impressive point rebound and assist despite cousin rust and apparent lack of conditioning golden state outscored the clipper by point in his time on the floor before he fouled outthis is his night curry said afterwardit certainly wa the foot inch cousin hammered home a vicious dunk for his first basket a a warrior ran the floor with aplomb hounded the various clipper he guarded one on one into for shooting found a cutting curry for a layup with a nifty bounce pas out of the post took a charge against a driving tobias harris and most notably drained three pointerstwo of those s early in the fourth quarter really broke the whole game open warrior coach steve kerr saidmost of all cousin smiled he smiled and laughed a lot he soaked in a celebratory waterdousing on live tv from curry and thompson proudly awarded the game ball to his mother monique and came away from his first real game action in day by proclaiming it probably one of the best day of my lifelike a kid on christmas cousin saidand that might be the most ominous aspect of cousin longanticipated bow with the juggernaut he joined on a bargain deal via free agency last summer that oneyeardeal worth just million came amid leaguewide concern about how cousin would respond to a torn achilles tendon in his left foot historically one of the sport most devastating injury the resultant skepticism wiped out most of his freeagent marketyet cousin just one game into the warrior experiment already look content and comfortable with this groupif that continuesthings should only get better from here curry saidsaid kerr of cousin teammate they all love him he a really good teammate he an emotional guy but he lovedeven with a playful nickname like boogie there have been few happy occasion in the pro for cousin who ha played more nba game than any other active player without a taste of the postseason and had been sidelined since he shredded his achilles a a member of the new orleans pelican on jan but his desire to find a productive role with the franchise that ha won three title over the past four season wa very clear on friday night playing in short burst to start every quarter cousin still found the time to flash every facet of the versatile skill set that when it neutralizes the emotional side that kerr referenced ha long made him one of the league most tantalizing talentshes going to help them clipper coach doc river said forlornly he doe so many thingsin the th game of what curry himself described a a very dramatic season for the warrior cousin return also helped golden state shed some of the aftertaste from it last visit here to play the clipper when a nasty argument on the bench between durant and green led to green onegame suspension without pay and considerable tension afterwardthose scene seemed particularly dated on friday even a curry cast a wary eye on all the gushing sure to emerge in coming day about how mighty golden state now look with all five of it reigning allstars in uniformwere not going to drink all the koolaid curry promised insisting that the integration of cousin remains a work in progressstill no nba team ha been able to trot out a lineup featuring five allstars from the previous season since the boston celtic well aware of such history kerr tried before tipoff to convince his player to tune out the external noisetheres going to be instant judgment analysis and criticism kerr said after the morning shootaround were either going to be at the end of the night unbeatable or in big troubleasked after friday emphatic triumph if it wa thus safe to proclaim his team unbeatable kerr joked yes please go ahead season overwhile thing arent quite that hopeless for the league other team it sure seems a though a new season just started for the warrior who are back atop the western conference despite a record that isnt a gaudy a usual the clipper might have been shorthanded without the injured lou williams and with a hobbled danilo gallinari but the warrior ability to slot cousin in among their marquee foursome or mix him in with trusted reserve such a livingston and andre iguodala quickly made them look a dangerous a they ever have during their championship runnoting that he wasnt being doubleteamed no matter what the lineup on the floor were cousin called it a first in his careeri can get used to this he saidadvertisement

the raptor creditcreditronald cortesgetty imagessupported byby marc steinsan antonio high above the floor at the att center hang the retired number of eight former san antonio spur kawhi leonard seemingly ha a very strong case to see his old no hoisted among them somedayi would think so danny green said thursday night when he and leonard made their shared return to san antonio a member of the toronto raptorshes a final mvp led this team to a championship won a couple defensive player of the year green added not everybody who come through here ha done thatyet it likewise true that no spur over these past two decade of rampant san antonio success left town the way leonard did no prominent spur before leonard in the gregg popovich era ever forced his way out in such contentious circumstancesso you have to believe that it going to be a long time around here before the spur and especially their jilted fan will be able to look back with fondness on the undeniable high of leonard time in the alamo city that wa the clear conclusion after the spur inflicted a rout upon the raptor in the team first meeting since the blockbuster trade in july that sent leonard to toronto thanks to the copious amount of vitriol heaped in his direction for nearly three hoursonce dubbed the future face of the franchise by popovich himself leonard wa booed relentlessly in his first game a a visitor to the building that served a home for his first seven nba season he wa lustily booed on all shot he took during pregame layup line heard the home crowd displeasure even louder when he wa introduced right after the beloved green and wa booed every time he took possession of the ball for four full quartersduring a pregame tribute video titled thank you danny kawhi leonard and green were alternately jeered and cheered depending on whose face showed up on the video board overhead and on a trip to the freethrow line late in the first half leonard wa serenaded with an unmistakable chant of traitor traitor traitorthe spur capitalized on the energy in the building a well a the injury absence of the toronto allstar point guard kyle lowry back and romped to a lead leonard finished with a muted point and found little comfort beyond a postgame hug with popovich just two night removed from a careerbest point in a victory over utahi embraced it enjoyed the moment and it only going to make me better leonard insisted afterwardlocal satisfaction wa only amplified by the performance from the allstar demar derozan that san antonio acquired from toronto in exchange for leonard to underline the marked improvement in his playmaking since becoming a spur a well a surely to spite the toronto general manager masai ujiri for giving up on him derozan totaled point rebound and assist for his first career tripledoublei told him it wa about time joked popovich who added that derozan is playing downhill and attracting a crowd to subsequently find open teammate better than he ever envisioned when the trade wa madei didnt know about the passing popovich saidcathartic a the whole evening seemed though it will take much more than one beatdown for the spur to say they have healed from the event of last season the team relationship with leonard steadily deteriorated to the point that the most valuable player of the nba final rather than sign a million contract extension stunningly asked outthe presumed cause of that breakdown is disagreement over the treatment of a mysterious leg injury that limited leonard to nine game last season we have to presume because leonard ha yet to explain the root of his discontent saying again at thursday morning shootaround when asked to share his motivation for seeking a trade im not going to discus that here todaywhats undeniable is that the spur were rocked by and are still recovering from leonard determination to play elsewhere this season and then proceed to free agency in july when the los angeles clipper are widely expected to emerge a a serious threat to sign leonard away from the raptorsthroughout the popovich era which began in earnest when he took over a coach game into the season san antonio ha emphasized and taken great pride in it player relation a much a any team on the nba map it a big reason the leonard saga stung the organization so deeplyit wa rough on everybody said san antonio guard bryn forbesperhaps thats why popovich when speaking to reporter before the game struggled to play down the occasion he initially dismissed the hoopla surrounding leonard return a a focus for mostly you guy in the news medium before ultimately admitting but i get it popovich understands a well a anyone that these wound wont heal quickly for anyone in south texasthe spur mind you are trying theyre up to a surprising seventh in the western conference at despite a shortage of point specialist at a time they have never been more valued in the game a well a concern coming into the season about their collective ability defensivelyafter a skid in early december in which it suffered defeat by and point san antonio ha won of the spur also rank no in the league in offensive efficiency and no in defensive efficiency over the past month since allowing point in a dec victory over the los angeles lakersit wont be long though before the spur are reunited with leonard again the backdrop will be completely different with toronto playing host to san antonio on feb in front of what will surely be an adoring audience at scotiabank arena but many of the same emotion are bound to be dredged upthey love him raptor coach nick nurse said of leonard they love their player in toronto a you know and he give them a little bit more every gameas for where he stand with the san antonians who once regarded him a an heir to those immortalized in the rafter most notably tim duncan and david robinson leonard wa forced to acknowledge that it way too soon to even imagine repairing the damage his departure causedi really dont reflect on what happened probably until i retire leonard saidan earlier version of this article used an outdated name for the toronto raptor home court it is now scotiabank arena not air canada

the start they began the season with the youngest roster in the nba with an average age of le than year old development became the mantra with fizdale who in his first season a the knicks head coach ha frequently referred to his player a kid inexperience a revolvingdoor rotation and the absence of kristaps porzingis the star forward who ha been out injured since february compounded the losingnow after last week trade that sent porzingis to the dallas maverick ended any hope that he might return to save the season the knicks could be in danger of finishing with the worst record in franchise

that would seem to invalidate some of the criticismphiladelphia followed it trade for butler on nov by acquiring tobias harris from the los angeles clipper on feb giving brown two allstarcaliber player to team with the dynamic duo of joel embiid and ben simmons and the shooter extraordinaire jj redick in the first game since when those five player share the floor butler ha scaled back more than anyone taking fewer shot than the other four with embiid by far in the lead shotsof course in fourth quarter butler ha emerged a the most reliable offensive option of the quintet shooting for when all five play together highlighted by last week gamewinning jumper against boston after the celtic had won six of the team seven previous meeting the natural drop in butler pergame average this

advertisementsupported byon pro basketballthe maverick rookie is drawing lebron james comparison and ha fastforwarded his team decisionmakingby marc steindallas dirk nowitzki ha seen many thing in his season with the dallas maverick what he had never seen until last month wa a fellow maverick who could attract nearly two dozen autograph seeker in subzero temperature to greet the team bus on a thursday morning in detroitluka doncic did just that in the am hour of jan a the maverick pulled into a hotel adjacent to the world headquarters of general motor on the unglamorous end of a backtoback set that began in new yorkit is likewise safe to presume that none of nowitzkis other teammate over two decade in dallas could have inspired what happened mere hour later in a swiftmoving blockbuster trade dallas acquired kristaps porzingis from the knicks to serve a doncics sidekick with maverick general manager donnie nelson openly admitting that he pushed for the deal because doncic ha fastforwarded a lot of our decisionmakingthese are the tale from just one day albeit maybe the wildest day of what nowitzki frequently refers to a lukamaniawhen we get to city now even late at night there are so many people waiting with thing for him to sign that it almost like were the warrior nowitzki said lukamania is real were living it every dayanother rookie the perimeter cant protect you from mitchell robinsonthis week brings another milestone for doncic who celebrates his th birthday on thursday he is averaging point rebound and assist through game and is responsible for four of the five tripledoubles in nba history recorded by teenager it is a start that ha quickly validated nelson longheld belief that doncic possessed superstar potentialthe only other rookie in league history to hit those level over a full season wa oscar robertson in i love love love guy that can pas the ball nelson said prioritizing doncics ability to run a team at foot inch over the fact he is already known for having the league secondmostfeared stepback jump shot behind only james hardensi knew i could play over here doncic said but it better than i expected for surethe gaudy number and worldwide interest in his exploit enabled doncic to amass more than four million vote in nba allstar balloting trailing only lebron james and giannis antetokounmpo doncic in other word finished higher in leaguewide balloting than michael jordan fifth did a a rookie higher too than james th and even yao ming who could manage only the fourthhighest total in despite the considerable voting might of yaos native chinadoncics instant production ha also validated every pundit who insisted amid no shortage of skepticism that concern about doncics athleticism and corresponding ability to deal with the length of nba defender were folly given the rampant success he achieved both at the club real madrid and national team slovenia level a an yearold in the process doncic ha unleashed a torrent of secondguessing upon the team phoenix sacramento and atlanta that let him slip to the maverick yet doncic insists his maiden nba season which appears destined to be christened with the league rookie of the year trophy ha not been a easy it looksthe maverick you see were entering wednesday night home date with indiana and likely to miss the playoff for a third consecutive season they have traded away all four of doncics projected fellow starter dennis smith jr deandre jordan wes matthew and harrison barnes in deal that netted porzingis and roughly million in salarycap space neither of which can help the team this seasonit is the first time in doncics life since he took up basketball at age that he ha experienced losing one hint of how well he coping with it doncic ha pulled his jersey apart in frustration after a play gone awry twiceits harder than people think doncic saidhes a winner he won everything in europe juancho hernangomez of the denver nugget said so every time he loses he get so madhernangomez ha been observing doncic from close range for year both on the floor since doncic played alongside hernangomezs brother charlotte willy hernangomez at real madrid and through their shared whatsapp chat room which house various european player fond of the popular video game fortnite but maverick official are not worried about a scouting report from a friend that paint doncic a a sore loserhe doesnt handle losing well i know that for a fact dallas coach rick carlisle said but i dont handle losing well eitheras recently a may maverick executive were worried about doncic big time having known for more than a year that they wanted to draft him if they had the chance team official were crestfallen in chicago when dallas slipped from a projected no in that night draft lottery to no it wa devastating for u nelson said we thought our chance to get him wa gone because it really hard to trade up in the lottery nowitzki betrayed a public hint of the organization disappointment when he tweeted this reaction of courseto move up high enough dallas ultimately had to persuade the atlanta hawk to surrender the no overall pick it cost dallas both the no pick which atlanta used to take trae young a well a the maverick top pick in the draft but the dallas owner mark cuban blessed the deal even at that price because nelson lobbied so hard for it five year earlier during the draft nelson and his longtime international scout tony ronzone pushed for the maverick to use the no pick on a littleknown greek teenager named giannis antetokounmpo cuban wouldnt allow it given that antetokounmpo unlike doncic wa mostly a mystery and promptly regretted it a antetokounmpo blossomed into a star in milwaukeeso this time after the disappointment of the lottery cuban blessed nelson to do whatever it took to land doncic what the team got wa the son of a former slovene pro sasa doncic and a veteran of three full season in the euroleague and spain la liga with real madrid after luka doncic made his pro debut at to the maverick delight doncic wa more nbaready than they ever dreamed a his for shooting in the final three minute of onepossession game this season would suggest a carlisle put it unique background unique skill set unique body typei hesitate to throw out name like lebron james and magic johnson who have been doeverything kind of star but it pretty clear now that luka ha many of those same trait and ha proven that he can do a lot of those thing carlisle said he ha deceptive size strength and quickness and an understanding beyond his year on how to use his body to make play and draw foulscarlisle is hardly alone in making such lofty comparison miami dwyane wade one of the league foremost james expert after their four season together with the heat ha called doncics passing lebronlike los angeles clipper coach doc river said of doncic he my favorite player to watch almost and not talking just rookie first of all he play with a great joy i love that and he just so advanced in the way he play the sky the limit for him wait until he get in shaperivers wa laughing when he tacked on that last line but he did hit on a prime area of year concern with doncic conditioningthe maverick and doncics representative headed by the longtime nba agent bill duffy agreed shortly after the draft to impose a much rest on doncic a possible from july through september after a nonstop run at the highest level of international basketball for nearly a year doncic thus began the season heavier than his listed weight of and ha absorbed jibe about his diet ever sincebut maverick official are pleased with the gradual change in doncics dietary habit at the team behest doncic hired a chef in december to prepare a number of meal for pregame and offnight consumption doncic ha also begun working fresh juice into his routinein madrid doncic lived for the past two and a half year with his mother mirjam poterbin who raised doncic while running two beauty salon in ljubljana doncic ha long declined to discus his fatherin dallas mom and son live separately near the american airline center a doncic grows into his independence but still within walking distancethis wa his dream poterbin said at year old he wa already talking about nba i cry a lot of timesyet there have been year challenge and disappointment for doncic amid the

achilles tear in january he lived through his first big trade seeing dallas abruptly abort it planned doncicsmith jr partnership when the chance arose to acquire his pal porzingisi wa shocked doncic

admitted that doncic wa quite sad at first about missing out on an allstar spot because of a format change in which fan balloting a of last season only account for percent of the equation for determining startersthe good news these all rank a welcome test even the maverick sub record compared to the early hurdle posed by the transition doncic faced at that wa his tender age when doncic

giannisantetokounmpo joelembiid kyrieirving kembawalkerstephencurry jamesharden paulgeorge kevindurantkawhileonard pictwittercomaycxldckgthe second round will feature the reserve and the third round will feature the game two veteran ambassador dirk nowitzki of the dallas maverick and dwyane wade of the miami heat team lebron scott cacciola will pick first in the first and third round and team giannis benjamin hoffman will pick first among the reserve round one startersteam lebroncacciola if im channeling my inner lebron im rewarding harden for his ridiculous first half of the season by making him the first pick and im going to expect him to take no fewer than stepback s from just inside halfcourtteam giannishoffman there are argument to be made for other player but once you consider gianniss skill set there is no one more complementary than curry with the space created by curry outside shooting he actually gotten more bold with long pointer if you can believe it the lane will be wide open for the dunk that will get giannis named the game most valuable playerteam lebroncacciola wait a second ben i didnt know we were treating this like an actual game with actual strategy that change everything or doe it putting aside personal rivalry with my second pick im taking kevin durant because he too is really good at basketball i also want to reunite him with harden his former teammate and let them fight over the ballteam giannishoffman im not loving the size disparity so far harden is officially only three inch taller than curry but is also somehow at least two foot taller than curry so ill take the biggest guy in the starter pool but based on my stated goal of designing a team to get giannis the mvp award i would be careful about having these two on the floor together all that much unless we start to fall behindteam lebroncacciola i need a defensive stopper while i acknowledge that a case could be made for paul george a the league top defender this season is there any question that leonard will approach this game the same way he doe a midmarch clash with the buck the guy doe not turn off the intensity ever so im having him guard all five guy at once because i already know that no one else will even pretend to play defenseteam giannishoffman there a legitimate argument that you have the best four player on the court so far and despite my belief that my guy are perfect to play with each other im getting a little nervous the obvious play here would be to counter the kawhi pick with george but i want to avoid the lebronkyrie pairing because ive seen how dangerous it can beteam lebroncacciola im going with more size and more versatility with my final pick among the starter and i think youre in trouble ben a quick aside george ha been incredible for the thunder this season and he look like a man playing with an untroubled conscience and without the distraction of free agency and looming future decision if you take a look at this current batch of allstars that make george something of a rare breedteam giannishoffman ok so i didnt actually have a choice to make here but if there going to be one guy left in a gym waiting to be picked it pretty good for it to be a guy who had a point game earlier this season and who happens to be playing in his home arena my team is small and fast so far but over all there a starpower gap that im going to have to make up for in the reserve which i will do from the start by stealing anthony davis before actual lebron steal him from the actual pelicansteam lebron james harden kevin durant kawhi leonard paul georgeteam giannis stephen curry joel embiid kyrie irving kemba walkerround two reservesteam giannisteam lebronteam giannishoffman it almost entirely a function of format but a guy who will most likely finish second to harden in mvp voting going with the th pick is a little weird jokic doe a lot of thing well he a passing savant he a good rebounder he shoot better than you probably think and he provides some size without sacrificing the fluid ball movement ill have to hope can be built through my startersteam lebronteam giannisteam lebroncacciola im not exactly sure what it mean that westbrook is the th overall pick in our mock draft maybe it mean that the league is so rich with toptier talent that it not even shocking that a former mvp who is again averaging a tripledouble slipped to the middle of the second round but here we areteam giannisteam lebronteam giannisteam lebronteam giannisteam lebronteam giannisteam lebronround three ambassadorsteam lebroncacciola this is the most obvious pick in the entire draft this side of anthony davis wade and james go way back well before the banana boat day and wade ha already made it abundantly clear that james better pick him with retirement around the bend for wade the game will be full of nostalgia not only for wade but for the partnership he formed with james and chris bosh in miami when superstar conglomerate were still a novel conceptteam giannishoffman one of the greatest scorer in nba history dirk cant really move around much and other than getting in the game to launch a jumper or two he not a lot of added value on the court but off the court he still one of the funniest player in the league taking a look at team lebron my bench may need some moment of levity in what could turn into an ugly gamecan i mock your pick instead of treating this like an actual game with something a mainstream a a prediction we are looking for free agency clue in thursday draft not basketball decision i suppose i will go with team lebroncacciola over team giannishoffman if im forced to choose but what we really want to know is will lebron draft irving andor davis he always ha a downtheroad plan in mindbenjamin hoffman

defensive rating allowing just point per possession and specializes in the physical style that ha troubled golden state in the past the thunder have undoubtedly benefited from what rank a the league secondeasiest schedule to date but you would struggle to find a star duo meshing better than russell westbrook and paul george houston rocket earlier this season i responded to the rocket disappointing start and chris paul ongoing hamstring issue by stopping just short of proclaiming the window to contention closed for james harden and co houston is since dec with harden averaging a mere point and point attempt per game in that stretch write the rocket off if you wish but hardens brilliance augmented by a resurgent clint capela and the newcomer austin river should give you pause indiana pacer surprise no only six team in the league according to basketballreferencecoms projection will finish the season with at least win surprise no indiana is on that list ahead of

have the unfashionable pacer overachieving again san antonio spur this season start marked the first time gregg popovich ha ever sported a sub record after game and included a fourgame stretch in

efficiency in that span led by the midrange maestro demar derozan and lamarcus aldridge flatout ignoring the league point revolution boston celtic the number continue to say that the celtic are fine they have a pergame average point differential that rank second only to milwaukee boston is also one of just four team along with milwaukee toronto and denver to rank in the top in both offensive ninth and defensive fourth efficiency the problem boston just followed up an impressive rout of indiana with loss in miami and orlando that suggested yet again that thing are not fine philadelphia er for all the creative tension that ha bubbled around the sixer since they acquired jimmy butler on nov they have the fourthbest overall record in that span despite wellchronicled concern about shooting and depth around philadelphia star trio a well a the occasional squawking butler fit alongside joel embiid and ben simmons ha been le than seamless a predicted but stockpiling a much talent a possible

lakers are since james suffered a strained groin in a christmas day rout of golden state a a result they have slid from a higherthanexpected no to an uncomfortable no in the west thus resurrecting all the preseason question about la ability to make the playoff with shall we say such an eclectic roster james appears likely at to miss more than the game stephen curry lost to a similar injury in

make sense whether it is miami ability to play basketball despite missing out on butler via trade and having goran dragic healthy for just game or the fact this team is against atlanta it is unclear how long it will take miami to get back into the trade mix for a player of butler caliber but the retiring dwyane wade should have an opportunity to bid the game farewell from the playoff stage

for the los angeles clipper next game no injury update or juicy trade rumor eitherkalamian simply felt an urgency to let river know that it had happened again another burst of the scoreboard overload that ha dominated this nba season even more than the starladen golden state warriorsa laughing river recounted how kalamians summary pointed out that nearly every winner that night jan scored to point it wa like five team up there river saidin truth it wa only four indiana atlanta golden state and philadelphia but river point wa made a leaguewide push by team to shoot more pointer and take more shot earlier in the shot clock than ever before combined with a freedomofmovement crusade driven by the league office ha resulted in an offensive boom rendering score in the s routine with few sign of it abatingthe trend ha not been met with universal approval some of the game biggest name including gregg popovich charles barkley and stan van gundy continue to register concern that team are abandoning too many traditional offensive principle in favor of rampantly hoisting stop defender like golden state draymond green and denver paul millsap have also charged that tighter refereeing ha made it harder than ever to counter the offensive wizardry of dynamic newage scorer like houston james harden who rumbled for point wednesday night at madison square garden to cap a fivegame streak in which harden averaged a colossal pointsthe review though have generally been more positive than negative the nbas team are averaging point per game collectively up from last season representing the highest rate since when it wa a team league that wasnt nearly a sophisticated in it defensive concept and scouting techniquesthe game is the most skilled that ive ever seen it said river who played in the nba from to and ha been a head coach since i like watching the game now so i guess thats my answer but it a different game there no doubt about itsaid millsap who made four allstar appearance with atlanta before joining the nugget in july you cant really touch guy now so the foul are up point shooting is definitely up and the scoring upmillsap though is not convinced that those thing are necessarily worrisomeits fun for the fan to see he said it fun to see good team get point so im all for itas recently a three season ago in team managed to crack the point barrier only five time that number rose to last season this season it ha already happened time entering friday play which coincides with the league average for point attempt per game crossing the threshold for the first time in league history at the league office however insists that inflating score further wa not the aim when it announced that existing rule would be enforced with greater frequency this season the rule in question forbid player to hold push charge into impede the progress of an opponent or take any other measure that could be interpreted a causing the player guarded to be reroutedkiki vandeweghe the nbas executive vice president for basketball operation said the push to enforce such violation with more vigilance stemmed from longstanding team complaint about physicality away from the ball and in the post in an era when more and more coach have favored switching defense that call for defender to pas player off to a nearby teammate instead of trying to fight through screensthose rule were always there vandeweghe saidthe freedomofmovement movement gained steam last summer when coach like boston brad stevens and utah quin snyder led the lobbying against the proliferation of switching defense creating too many opportunity in vandeweghes word for holding and grabbing and physical play off the ballyet thats just one element of a cocktail that ha changed the offensive equation a wildly a the nba witnessed in the season when the pairing of steve nash and coach mike dantonis famed seven second or le offense abetted by the league crackdown on handchecking began to revolutionize offensive philosophy the campaign to curtail physical play wa among the factor that helped transform nash from a mere allstar point guard to a twotime winner of the most valuable player awardthe warrior led by their splash brother backcourt of stephen curry and klay thompson then took dantonis freewheeling approach to a new level in their first championship season in by averaging pointer and a leaguehigh possession per minutesthe rocket now coached by dantoni have since made golden state look comparatively restrained averaging point shot per game last season and per game this season houston devotion to pointer and layup and preferably nothing in between at the behest of their analyticsobsessed general manager daryl morey is such that harden co are attempting more pointer than pointer a a team for the second consecutive seasonentering friday game team were averaging at least pointer per game while pace is another area that ha revved thing up dramatically team are averaging possession per minute this season which is only possession more than last season but consider that the sun highest pace average in nash peak year possession per minute in would rank th this seasonmy first year here we were no in the league in pace and it felt like we were running past everybody every night golden state coach steve kerr said this year i think were playing even faster than we did in but were middle of the pack the whole league ha shifted in term of priority and stylevandeweghe is convinced that when the competition committee reconvenes next month during allstar weekend in charlotte to ass how the game is being played and officiated there will be more praise than grumblesi still remain the complaint department vandeweghe said but most of the feedback i get is the game look better kerr is among the frequent objector despite the fact his team seemingly benefit a much a any from a freeflowing game he contends offensive player are not punished enough on traveling call and when pushing off on drive to the basket which fuel kerrs contention that it ha never been more difficult to guard in the nba than it is right nowid like to see a balance where the rule are still geared toward these high score because i think a lot of people enjoy that but youve got to give the defense a chance kerr said were giving so much of an advantage to the offensive playerproponents of the pointer laud it comeback potency in term of wiping out big deficit quickly but there no dodging the fact that blowout are on the rise there have been game already this season decided by point or more compared to just total last season and a record in i think a lot of people maybe in the nba office and some of the medium just equate scoring with excitement stan van gundy the espn analyst and former miami orlando and detroit coach said on a recent nbc sport habershow podcast close competitive game regardless of style of play are always excitingi think were headed in the wrong direction were ok right now where are we going to be in five year is everybody going to shoot or s a gamethere ha been no louder critic of the direction offense are trending than popovich who routinely us the word boring to describe the proliferation of shot behind the point line san antonios point attempt per game which ranked last in the league would have ranked no a recently a the seasoneverybody penetrates to shoot s so the artfulness of the game is sort of getting lost popovich said last week and everybody doe the same thing because the analytics drive it where shooting these s seems to be the smart thing to doso you end a game and the first stat you look at is if one team shot s well and the other one didnt game over you dont have to look at rebound turnover anything else that tell the whole tale and thats pretty boringpopovich wa then asked if the spur leaguelow total of point attempt is by strategic design in response to the lost artfulness or more a byproduct of san antonios roster which feature two elite midrange scorer in lamarcus aldridge and demar derozan but no point guard adept at getting into the paint and collapsing defensesif we were able to get more s popovich

rarely bestowed on woman college basketball which despite improved play and the introduction of a few more top program ha struggled to broaden it appealogunbowale appeared on the ellen degeneres show where kobe bryant greeted her a a surprise guest she participated in the television competition dancing with the star she won the espy award for play of the yearshout out to woman basketball a a whole

nominee mostly from men sport ogunbowale chose to promote her gametheres still a long way to go which is why we have to advocate for ourselves ogunbowale said in an interview last monthi think our final four wa superexciting she added noting that the other semifinal had also gone to overtime and that got people thinking like ok yeah it actually fun to watchthe final four and the response to it illustrated just how intertwined the discussion of woman basketball is with a more meta discussion about woman basketball popularityif arike were on the men side you take that and roll with it said courtney cox a doctoral candidate at the university of southern california who study woman basketball but instead she ha all this pressure to come back and do it againif it win twice this weekend notre dame would be only the fourth woman basketball team to repeat a national champion and if ogunbowale again play a starring role she seems a good a candidate a any to become the rare woman basketball star to have the kind of firstname status enjoyed by star athlete like michael kobe lebron and serenathis notion of growing the game is this phrase we hear a lot wnba college game cox said but i think the game is flourishing part of it is acknowledging the disparity thats already existed the fact that the woman tournament ha only existed on the ncaa level since the college basketball establishment ha changed several visible aspect of the woman game in an effort to increase it exposure for instance ogunbowales shot might have made a larger splash because they came on a friday and a sunday the night before the men semifinal and title game rather than the sundaytuesday time slot that the woman final four had previously occupiedthat wa one of several recommendation made in a paper that val ackerman the first wnba president wrote for the ncaa in amid fear of declining attendance stagnant rating and a topheavy woman tournament others included experimental rule change such a a second shot clock and toying with a slightly lower rim considering making woman basketball a onesemester sport and even hosting the men and woman final four in the same city or establishing a multiyear site for the woman event much a omaha always host the college world seriesthe visibility level are a bit lower than they are in the men said ackerman who is now the big east commissioner it just one of the broader challengesof ogunbowale ackerman added the aftermath of that championship for her proved that it can happen when you have compelling performance on a national stagethere is more than one kind of compelling though one of this season more interesting moment also involved ogunbowale and occurred when connecticut visited notre dame for a nonconference game in december during the game which the husky won easily ogunbowale received a technical foul when she appeared to have word with connecticut coach geno auriemma the latest spat between the two who once subtweeted one another when ogunbowale dropped uconn from her list of program during recruitingneither ogunbowale nor notre dame coach muffet mcgraw would address the technical directly in interview but the argument that it wa good for the game that it resembled the drama that drive the nba news cycle wa made by the like of the espn writer darcy maine who said im here for all the pettinessmuch a the nba ha ridden

advertisementsupported byby marc tracya freakish injury to duke zion williamson college basketball best and most prominent player only second into a game on wednesday night ha instantaneously renewed a debate about the contradiction of the sport economic foundation shining a harsh new light on the ncaas policy of amateurism and the influence of billiondollar shoe companiesit also raised an important question should williamson ever suit up for another college gamefans were asking the question an nba player wa too even before duke announced that williamson had sprained his right knee in the fallits a legitimate question said ramogi huma the founder and president of the college athlete player association an advocate for player rightsin the first minute of topranked duke game against it archrival eighthranked north carolina williamson a foot pound forward whose game is a blend of quickness and power pivoted with the ball near the freethrow line a he planted a foot to reverse direction his left sneaker collapsed and tore apart from the sheer torque of the movewilliamson fell backward in a split grabbing his right knee he walked off the court and did not return duke coach mike krzyzewski said afterward that williamson had sustained a knee injury but that the joint wa stablepending further testing the general sense is that williamson and duke and nike which made the shoe had avoided the worst williamson widely considered the nation best college player is expected to be available to duke in time for it conference tournament or the ncaa tournament which begin in a monththat is should williamson elect to returnhuma cited the example of a top football player who found himself with a more serious injury a few year ago that player elected to end his college career prematurely to limit the risk to his professional payday to continue to risk his future in an unjust system that doesnt allow him to be compensated just doesnt make sense huma saidthe math behind the argument against williamsons returning is simple per ncaa rule duke is not compensating williamson an yearold freshman beyond a scholarship and the related cost of studying at and playing for the universitythat is how the college sport economy work even a duke it conference the atlantic coast conference television network and of course nike the apparel company that sponsor duke and made the shoe that so spectacularly ripped apart reap billion of dollar from the effort and talent of preprofessional athlete like williamsonas a private university duke doe not release detail of it apparel deal the university recently extended it current agreement through north carolina mile away receives about million a year from nike texas michigan and ohio state which have more prominent football program than duke and north carolina have nike deal worth closer to million annuallytickets to wednesday night game at duke were being offered for more than on the secondary marketwilliamson so far ha earned nothing partly for this reason everyone agrees that he is planning to enter this year nba draft the first for which he is eligible he is widely expected to be the no overall pick and receive a starting contract that would net him ten of million of dollar even before that but only after his college career is over the telegenic williamson known since high school for his thunderous dunk will be free to sign milliondollar endorsement dealsthe only thing that could halt these inevitability would be a serious injury that substantially lowered his draft value while there is insurance for this kind of event it rarely pay out and most likely could never account for the loss of value of williamsons future professional contractsso the argument go why chance it by returning to duke at alleven if williamson ha a simple sprain of his medial collateral ligament a minor injury that in a perfect world might not sideline him for more than a week or two the risk of returning to a team that doe not pay him is borne solely by williamsondonovan mitchell who played for two year at louisville before the utah jazz selected him in the nba draft suggested a much in a tweet after williamson wa hurt on wednesday night writing again let remember all the money that went into this game and these player get none of it and now zion get hurt something ha to change ncaathere are however also reason for williamson to return to try to help the blue devil win their sixth national championship he may feel loyalty to his teammate who include several other freshman likely bound for the nba this year or to his coach many young basketball player grow up watching the ncaa tournament and dream of playing in it themselves a star turn in march and april would enhance williamsons formidable marketability even if it could do little to raise his draft stockstill even college administrator said he should at least consider skipping itevery time there something like this there need to be continual exploration and dialogue about what if anything should be done to make it different said dan beebe a consultant and former commissioner of the big conferencedo we provide more resource because of all the money coming in and others who are benefiting from it including coach athletic director commissioner beebe added but then you get into really complex question that need to be asked about how far do you go with thatin football a more injuryprone sport there have been recent example of player skipping seasonending bowl game before they enter the nfl draft in october ohio state defensive lineman nick bosa a junior had surgery after a core muscle injury while there wa no timetable for his return he announced then that he would withdraw from college to focus on recovering and training for the draftthe question surrounding williamsons option are related to those that an ncaa commission addressed last season after federal prosecutor revealed extensive corruption in college basketball recruiting some of the remedy the commission proposed could eliminate future situation like williamsons for instance it lobbied the nba and it player union to eliminate the current rule requiring player to be a year removed from high school before playing in the league the league already plan to create the opportunity for elite player to earn salary in it developmental league rather than attend collegebut the commission did not address what many say is the fundamental issue the gap between the money that player like williamson generate for university league apparel company and others and those player inability to be compensatedin that light what might be most shocking about williamsons current situation is that something like it did not happen sooneron wednesday hour before the dukenorth carolina game huma wa on the phone with a staff member for a washington state senator who is sponsoring a bill that would permit athlete to be paid and to retain agentsi literally gave the example what if zion

johnson wrote on twitter that he considers himself a laker for lifehe announced in that he wa hiv positive but said tuesday that he wa in good health and it wa not a factor in his decisionjohnson had sealed a million fouryear deal for james two great fulfilling their need johnson to restore luster to a glamorous team james to close out his career a a laker and develop his business and entertainment interest centered on hollywoodand now they both left staple center with a losing record and a team in chaosin some way it wa the perfect finale to a season that trafficked in dysfunctionso there wa the coach luke walton saying what losing coach always say essentially wait until next year his job may have been saved when johnson quit but he would not talk about thatwe have a lot of time to work and get better walton said late tuesday after the lakers loss to the portland trail blazer let organize and prioritize what we need to do so we can give ourselves a better chance next seasonit wa a wasted season for everyone involved and james is a polarizing a ever even in los angeles where a much a fan banked on him they also retained a degree of skepticism that this wa all realjonas never a prominent los angelesbased street artist found that out the hard wayhonestly never said in a telephone interview lakers fan are the trickiestlast july he had talked a restaurant owner in venice beach into allowing him to paint a mural of james in a lakers jersey to commemorate his arrival can of spray paint in hour for the king of lait did not take long for the mural to be vandalized not just once but twice in a span of four day the first time it wa salvageable someone had defaced the wall with the word we dont want you and no king along with a reference to james losing record in the nba final but never wa able to restore the mural a twominute fix he saidthe second time someone splashed yellow paint all over james face and never had no choice but to paint over itif it had been a car it would have been totaled he saidto be fair most fan were excited about james the news medium coverage wa breathless and perhaps no member of the ticketpaying public had invested more in lebrontola than jacob emrani a personal injury lawyer from beverly hill calif who had purchased space for jamesthemed billboard in the runup to free agencyi definitely didnt think it wa going to be something where we missed the playoff or thought what the hell is happening here emrani said in an interview im disappointed in the break we got but im not necessarily disappointed in lebron we were in fourth place when he went downemrani wa referring to what may have been the season turning point the lakers illfated christmas day game against the golden state warrior which james himself cited in a recent interview with spectrum sportsnet the lakers broadcast partner the lakers were playing solid basketball at the time in fact they clobbered the warrior to improve their record to but james injured his groin in the third quarter and wound up missing the next game the lakers went into a tailspin without himdisappointed in my body james told spectrum sportsnet adding because i knew exactly where we were at that point and we just were never able to get back from thatonce james returned the team front office unsuccessfully tried to engineer a trade for another big star the new orleans pelican anthony davis this after james had told espn that it would be amazing to play alongside davisthe plan appeared to be to essentially trade away the rest of the team the fallout wa clear whatever fragile bond that remained in the home locker room at staple center seemed to fray at the seamsfor many fan it wa impossible to dissociate james from the failed trade james and davis share an agent rich paul and much of the mess that followednearly everyone on the roster wa involved in those trade rumor never said how can you really feel wanted if you think youre going to be packing your locker the next dayas the loss mounted so did the criticism of james that he appeared detached from his teammate that basketball wa secondary to his growing interest in his entertainment company that his body wa finally breaking down after so many year of athletic genius that he wa no longer capable of carrying a team to a titlebut in the game that james did play this season he wa pretty good he averaged point rebound and assist a game while shooting percent from the field besides a long summer may benefit him after so many extended playoff runsthe only thing that wa hard wa that he got hurt walton said late tuesday night it take time to build a relationship with somebody but a our relationship grew and i got to see what it wa like coaching him it wa great and i believe if we could have stayed healthy we would have had a very successful season he an incredible playerfor his part james told spectrum sportsnet that he wanted to use the summer to get his body back to percent ahead of training camp even a he moonlight on the set of space jam he ha been adamant that his work in entertainment will not interfere with his work on the basketball courtthe question is whether one bad season will become two so much hinge on the summer a the lakers look to add another star to their roster emrani said he had plan for more billboard though he declined to say which toptier free agent he would target james ha said that he will be a involved in the team recruiting effort a possibleim looking forward to seeing who jump in the car with me and want to take this ride to the top james

amassed an inventory of report that stretched from michael jordan to lebron james williamson who had just turned appeared to be an interior technician a player at ease turning on his defender to make it to the rim for understated finish because of williamsons body type konchalski considered him a lefthanded jamal mashburn a reference to the beefy bronx product who played season in the nbawhen

back konchalski say now he got it all wrongim wiping off copious amount of egg from my face he said williamson he know is anything but quiet by adam zagoriathe first time lebron james showed up to watch zion williamson they wouldnt let him in the doorit wa july and james once a transcendent teenage talent himself went to see williamson the next big thing at a showcase in la vega williamsons team south carolina supreme wa playing big baller brand which featured lamelo ball a brother of lakers guard lonzo ball it wa by summer youth basketball standard a mustsee eventjames of course wasnt the only one interested in that confluence of basketball stardust the nba player damian lillard andrew wiggins jamal murray and thon maker were in the gym by the time james arrived adding buzz to a crowd of more than that threatened to swamp a court configured to hold le than half that manyeven in warmups the excitement wa palpable the fan oohed and aahed a williamson tossed ball high in the air and dunked them many spectator held cellphone the better to share video clip of a scene that wa quickly called the craziest aau game ever but james never saw any of it with fan standing a dozen deep nearly spilling onto the court from every direction he and his group were told that just letting him into the gym constituted a security risk a teenager mere presence it seemed had squeezed out basketball biggest star james wa told he couldnt come inwe shut him down an adidas marketing executive told cbs sport at the time the corner were deep thats where it got insane it would be a year and a half before james got to see williamson play in person in february he took a minute flight from philadelphia to charlottesville va and watched from courtside a williamson playing for duke went for point rebound and assist in a win against virginia williamsons athleticism james declared wa ridiculous by david waldsteinbishop richardson wa averaging about three alleyoop assist to williamson every game when their team spartanburg sc day school arrived at ben lippen school in columbia sc for a game during williamsons junior year williamson dunked a lot back then and he had recorded at least two slam in the first half that had the gym rocking i remember it vividly williamson said last week their student section wa really into the game talking a lotthe real highlight though wa still to come with spartanburg ahead by point richardson a spindly guard who had played varsity since the eighth grade found himself jogging easily up the right sideline when he spotted williamson closing menacingly down the other side of the court he tried another lob he knew the pas didnt have to be perfectif you threw it anywhere near the rim richardson said he wa going to get it on this occasion richardson toss arrived well below the rim but that enabled williamson to do something outrageous he rose into the air reached out with two hand to grab the incoming pas at about shoulder height and still rising now high enough to peer inside the rim he wa about to shake used one sweeping circular motion to bring the ball down to his waist and then back up to the left side of his body before ramming it through the basket with his left handthe crowd erupted i remember thinking holy cow ive never seen anyone do anything like that let alone be a part of it richardson said people were falling out of the bleachersthe dunk made it onto highlight reel and national sport show within hour but richardson did not see a replay until the next day when he and teammate sneaked a peek in a study halli wish i could take credit for it richardson said but it wa completely accidental by marc tracyvertical leap is measured using a simple contraption a tall pole with a series of long metal finger that project horizontally from it on top of one another narrow wing stacked up up up at consistent increment it may seem lofi but it is also foolproof your vertical reach while jumping is the highest metal flange you are able to bat away from it set position subtract standing vertical reach from that number and you have a player vertical leap when duke put it player through the test one day last summer zion williamsons vertical leap wa measured at inch but to the teammate and duke staff member who were present mere number do not do the moment justicewe were all in shock the sophomore guard alex oconnell said williamson who went last wa off the chart on his first attempt he casually swatted aside the highest measurement a staff member adjusted the pole to it highest setting and reset the tab and williamson repeated the feat they put weight under the contraption to lift it a few more inch into the air williamson batted the highest measurement aside again it wa something you dont see a lot especially with a guy who is built like him flying through the air forward javin delaurier said it a sight to beholdnolan smith an assistant coach who played for four year at duke and several more in the nba and europe said he had never seen anything like it cam reddish another blue devil freshman said he missed out he said he wa in another part of the building when williamson tested the test itself i just heard that he broke the record reddish said zion thingsby kevin draperin the beginning the former duke standout jay williams kept track of the williamson hype the same way everybody else did through lowquality video clip shot in high school gym and then posted on the internet williamsons highflying play quickly became the eighth wonder of the world williams saidthen he saw him in person i have never seen a player casually do a in a game williams said of seeing williamson do precisely that in a game against clemson this season even when you saw vince do it in college he said referring to vince carter who played at the university of north carolina there wa a level of oomph that he needed to exert that type of energy my man casually did it in the game he did a like i would do a layupwilliams said play like that one were the reason comparing williamson to other basketball player is a mistake to me i wa looking at a football player who had the finesse of basketball ability he said ive never seen that before i played against julius pepper in college i remember him being the only guy carlos boozer wa somewhat intimidated to go against because he couldnt just move him around i remember thinking for the first time oh i wa looking at julius pepper but through a basketball lens what what julius wa agile but i am talking about the frame of the body it reminded me of a linebacker or a tight end just different by joe drape and marc tracyspike lee wa in his seat and barack obama wa settled in his down past the end of the duke bench but in front of north carolina luke maye in the space where zion williamson had stood a moment earlier there wa suddenly nothing i didnt hear anything man maye said thursday what everyone quickly realized wa that the story had quickly changed from a heated rivalry game topranked duke v no north carolina into something far more bizarre williamsons nike sneaker had broken apart a he made a move at the freethrow line he wa down north carolina wa racing upcourt and everyone else wa asking what just happened maye in that moment had the best seat in the house i just took the ball he said and just started goinginitially the blue devil were just a confused the first thing duke javin delaurier saw from his spot on the bench wa the sneaker on williamsons left foot or what wa left of it anyway it sole wa flapping free like a banner in the windto delaurier this counted a good newsi wa like oh no it just his shoe he said there wa a sigh of reliefhe had after all seen this before he had blown out a shoe before he had seen williamson do it too zion a big human being moving pretty fast changing direction delaurier said it happensby david waldsteini consider it my fault deandre hunter say nowhes not wrong late in a february game at virginia cavalier guard kyle guy whipped the ball crosscourt to his teammate deandre hunter who waited at the point line deep in the corner and without a duke player within foot of him williamson wa on the left side of the court playing his usual feisty active defense so hunter in the right corner took his time uncoiling the point attemptwilliamson though had closed the gap by then soaring across the court with five quick step he took off from about six foot away just a hunter unloaded i consider it my fault hunter said i took way too long setting it up and releasing the shot but he came a long way in fact williamson jumped so high and stretched so vertically that his right hand wa well above the height of the foot rim when he cleanly swatted hunter shot into the stand he just came out of nowhere hunter said worse news at least for hunter wa that the clip made it way to espns sportscenter and other highlight show and it is now a staple of the williamson youtube filmography i didnt know it wa going to be such a big deal hunter said recentlyadvertisement

are some of the most accomplished player with a dominant left handbut to have two top lefthanded player on the same team two floor leader capable of dominating game all by themselves is something else entirelyduke a team often laden with unique talent now feature zion williamson and his fellow southpaw r j barrett the two best lefty in college basketball both are freshman and destined for the top of this summer nba draft lottery making their last few game together in the ncaa tournament a lefthander delightthese guy would dominate with either hand the former duke star grant hill said but it definitely add another elementbasketball is not like baseball where lefthandedness can be a virtue for pitcher and for hitter some of whom learn to hit from both side of the plate to gain an advantage in hockey player shoot one way or the other and that tends to be it in football quarterback are known to throw strictly from one side or the other at least until patrick mahomes completed a pas with his left hand last seasonbut in basketball a in soccer and lacrosse ambidexterity is encouraged larry bird the hall of famer from indiana state and the boston celtic wa predominantly righthanded but he wa so good with his left hand that he once played a game in portland shooting almost exclusively lefty just a a challenge to himself and he wound up with a tripledoublewilliamson and barrett have demonstrated they can use either hand too williamson for one ha gained attention for his thunderous dunk and he doe not discriminate when he go above the rim many of his dunk have been with his right hand or both but two of his best stuff this season a windmill dunk against indiana and a degree slam against clemson were thrown down with his left handbarrett can be just a dominant on friday he had point and assist against north dakota stateits great being lefthanded barrett saidaccording to several study percent to percent of the global population is estimated to be lefthanded give or take a few bullpen specialist and the odd lefty placekicker but barrett and williamson are not the first for dukeafter all this is the college were lefty driesell played in the s and a recently a last year duke lefty big man marvin bagley iii wa taken with the second pick in the nba draft but duke coach mike krzyzewski doe not discriminateits cool being righthanded too krzyzewski saidbarrett who is listed a foot and pound arrived at the ncaa tournament averaging point and rebound a game williamson a bruising but athletically gifted pound forward wa averaging point rebound and blocksthat is a lefty combo that ha knocked out opponent already on friday north dakota state asked the lithe forward deng geu to cover williamson at least some of the time geu said before the game that he wa well aware that duke showcased two dominant lefty and the bison scouting report noted it clearly still sometimes that most basic information can escape a defender giving a lefty a microsecond advantageyou go over the scouting report several time to get it locked in your head geu said but once the ball go up sometimes you forget itduke is not the only recent college team to feature a pair of dominant lefty from to the domantas sabonis and the przemek karnowski gave gonzaga a lefthanded twintower frontcourt and one of the more prominent college basketball team to feature a pair of lefty wa st john in the mids with chris mullin and walter berrythat lefty duo led st john to the final four in a feat williamson barrett and duke hope to match shortly the former georgetown coach john thompson whose team beat st john in a national semifinal that year said the mullinberry combination might have been a tad more challenging to cope with because of their lefthandedness and thompson knew all about defending leftiesas a player with the boston celtic he wa often assigned to guard russell the game most successful lefthander during practicesruss wa great no matter what but i always thought it gave him a slight advantage said thompson who broadcast tournament game for westwood one radio you are so used to covering a guy right hand and then he go up with the other hand and it might give him that splitsecond he need to finishthompson also belief lefty have a slight advantage on defense too for the same reason opponent are not used to facing themhill who played season in the nba and in three national championship game with duke said lefthanded player often gave him headache when you are facing an elite lefthanded player you have to be really focused and locked in and guard them a little differently he saidcovering a superstar like harden or ginobili wa never easy he said but even some lefthanded role player like thaddeus young in particular caused him griefyoung used to give me problem hill said you think is it because he a lefty i dont know for sure but i always wondered thatwilliamson and barrett do not pose problem just because they are lefthanded but on top of all that size and talent it just one more thing for team to contend withits amazing to see barrett said you dont really know which way were going to goadvertisement

where they laid the groundwork for what they have becomethe whole point of the retreat wa to really get to know each other a little bit better said guard matt mooney a graduate transfer who scored

wa year old when my parent both graduate student from india moved from married student housing to a little home in raleigh nc with a basketball hoop in the backyard even a an immigrant from south asia i knew what that hoop meantbasketball is a religion in north carolina and i quickly became a disciple when i wa the nc state wolfpack won the ncaa championship in heartstopping fashion i still remember my dad taking me to the center of campus for the midnight celebration and being transfixed by the sheer size and emotion of itmy love for the game soon became an obsession i taught myself to shoot in the backyard and played against the neighborhood kid i learned to make up for my disadvantage on the court both real im definitely undersized and perceived no one expected a short indian kid to be any good through hustle and perfecting a low lefthanded heave that i used whenever i could beat my man into the lanemy crowning achievement came in the final second of a little league championship game when i went to the freethrow line with my team down a point both shot clanked around the rim but went inin college watching the sport became equally addictive especially now that i wa at uncchapel hill my senior year the tar heel won their fourth ncaa championshipnow at age i am a new york city dad who watch carolina basketball obsessively with his three son and who after a year hiatus thanks to a couple of knee surgery decided to play pickup again but on the court recently i came to a shocking realizationmy ugly but effective lefthanded heave wa no longer effective i had become the player in the pickup game who everyone leaf open from a distancecall it ego but i really didnt want to be that guy so i turned to the only expert i knew my yearold son basketball coachmacky bergman run steady bucket a nonprofit that teach more than boy and girl from around the city coach macky a everyone call him is a product of new york city basketball he wa a star player at bronx science and played four year at the university of rochester he assured me that anyone could learn to shoot if they put the time inbut could a middleaged undersized father of three really remake his jump shot and become a solid pickup basketball player againcoach macky and i met in early october on a typical outdoor court fencedin blacktop metal backboard rim with no net on second avenue and th street it wa am on a weekday so the place wa vacant except for a grousing tenant who lived near the court and asked u to practice a far away from his home a possible this somewhat safe space meant i could relax a little although the pressure wa still on a both macky and the time photographer sent to track my progress were both former college playerswe began with a shooting test a series of midrange and point jumper while moving between five spot on the court i did this time shooting free throw after each round by the end i wa drenched in sweatthe result werent great percent from the freethrow line percent on point jumper and an abysmal percent from the point line a for my selftaught shooting technique which even my son kavi had described a pretty ugly coach macky decided we would have to start over from scratchin our first few session we set about erasing the muscle memory of to develop proper form we started a close to the basket a possible almost directly under the rimthe ball wa to be perched just above my eye on the fingertip of my left hand directly underneath the right angle at the bend of my elbow my guide hand would hold the right side of the ballfor my lower body knee bent foot shoulderwidth apart weight on the ball of my foot then i wa to push the ball up not out release and follow through finger pointed downon the followthrough kobe sometimes join his thumb and index finger and his guide hand point at the basket macky would say steph curry guide hand flip out and his arm come togetherthe more shot i took the goal wa basket in a row the more i could feel myself adapting set shoot followthrough take one step forward and catch the ball a it come through the net repeat it wa surprisingly meditative before i knew it i had made it all the way to shot in a rowbut macky had identified some weaknessesfor one i wa landing with one leg practically a foot in front of the other macky had me stick a soccer ball between my leg and practice a series of jump shot while squeezing it between my kneesthis wa surprisingly hard either id brick the shot or the soccer ball would pop out until i focused on taking really small jump landing like i wa on train track kavi even sort of complimented me calling this an advanced drill that only the teenager docoach macky encouraged me to attend his weekly shooting clinic at a high school on the lower east side with about two dozen of his other student they were all between and year old including my soni tried to blend in by standing with the coach that didnt last long when macky assigned me to work with one of them torrence ested the first thing coach torrence said to me wa i got you old manwhen i asked kavi who he thought wa more embarrassed by the whole venture me or him his vague reply spoke volume tough to say he respondedfor the final lesson coach macky moved me out to the point line id never been comfortable shooting the three because my old jump shot wa a heave that began at the chest it wa all arm and no legsas it turned out id been learning how to be a better point shooter all along proper technique and good arc make for a more accurate shot regardless of distancethe difference wa clear in my final set of drill i shot above percent from the free throw line percent on my two pointer and a remarkably improved percent from point rangebut improving my stats wa never really the point ive started hooping again at the mcburney ymca on west th street and reconnecting with the sport ive loved since i wa a kid practicing in the backyard my jumper is still a work in progress but im not being left wide open on it anymoreat a recent pickup session with adult this time i wa shooting for the last spot in the next game and wa matched against the best shooter in our group we both made our

the nba draft but an invitation to the combine never came a few team had him work out but the message wa clear that he would not be among the nbas precious draft pickssix foot inch and solid but used to playing near the rim travis said he wa told he needed to add another dimension to his game be more versatile become a better passer decrease turnover become more athletic given that he suddenly had to decide whether to stay at stanford a a graduate student or to pursue a graduate degree in basketball somewhere elsefollow our live coverage of the ncaa tournament hereand thus wa created a different kind of oneanddone at college basketball top finishing school john caliparis kentucky the famed lair of ubertalented highschoolers who play one nbamandated season of game before entering the draftgranted im four five year older than these guy travis said last month sitting in a lounge outside the locker room of kentucky practice facility but i am here for a year similar to themtraviss decision wa striking because for more than a decade calipari ha been the most popular host of raw freshman rather than seasoned senior his modus operandi at kentucky ha been to accept without apology the best and yearolds in july coach them up and send them off to the nba the following june since calipari arrived in lexington in kentucky ha averaged three firstround pick a year most of them freshman the team ha also reached four final four and captured a national titleenter travis a twotime allpac firstteamer who turned in november he wa injured most of one season at stanford and a medical redshirt left him with one more year of eligibility but before leaving stanford he walked at graduation with his class he majored in science technology and society a course of study that attracts many of the techminded who arrive in palo alto with dream of staying in silicon valley after collegethat is why moving to kentucky also made perfect sense a highly recruited prospect from minneapolis five year ago travis had one year left and he sought out a school that could help him get to where he wanted to be a a basketball playeryoure playing something game a season but youre in practice almost day said travis analyzing the problem like an engineerso where can i go where im playing against a pro every day in practice he added i felt like this wa the best platform where everyone can potentially be a pro at their position and thats who youre training with at night thats who youre practicing with thats who youre hanging out with eating with everyone ha the same mindset of trying to be a professionalthe jury is still out on whether he ha sufficiently improved his draft stock two nba frontoffice executive who declined to be named because nba rule ban public discussion of prospect delivered mixed review one predicted travis will not be drafted and the other argued that thanks to traviss time at kentucky he had played his way into the low or midsecond roundcalipari ha had travis confined mostly to the paint but james clark a private coach who worked with travis last summer said that travis had improved his shooting to the point where he could play a a stretch four the valuable kind of power forward who can create more space for his offense by serving a a threat to score away from the rimi also think people are seeing how strong he is clark added he smart with the basketball he doesnt have a lot of turnoversat kentucky which face abilene christian in the first round of the ncaa men tournament on thursday in jacksonville fla travis emerged a a starter and key force near the basket because he is playing fewer minute on the starstocked wildcat most of his pergame statistic are down from the previous two season although his block total ha skyrocketed but his impact ha nonetheless been powerfulcalipari credited travis with wrestling grant williams the resident bruiser on rival tennessee to a draw in kentucky victory over it fellow no seed last month a if to prove caliparis point tennessee won the next meeting between the team when travis wa out with a sprained knee tennessee also won the rubber match by point in the southeastern conference tournament with travis back on the court but probably not at full strengthfor calipari the education of travis is a task at once unusual and familiarheres a kid that work like this that need a little extra stuff to be able to go reach his dream and it appealed to me calipari said during an interview in his officeat one point calipari referred to travis a a good kid and then scolded himself for calling travis a kidthe two bonded last fall during the contentious hearing over brett kavanaughs supreme court nominationwe talked about the supreme court stuff that wa going on said calipari a politics junkie havent been able to do that in the last eight or nine yearsone night at a team dinner calipari told travis he thought senator amy klobuchar of minnesota who played a prominent role in the hearing might make a compelling democratic presidential candidate travis agreed his family and klobuchars are family friend he went to high school with the senator daughter abigail bessler klobuchar entered the presidential race in februarytravis will spend the next few year trying hard to earn an nba spotcalipari is optimistic because travis can shoot create off the dribble and score he going to be one of those guy in that league who you want in your locker room you want on your team that ha the toughness to guard anybody calipari saidthe process might take time a lucky break more improvement or a combination of all three period of frustration seem likelyit is also easy to see travis eventually ending up in business school he aspires to athletic administration at stanford he took the time to get to know the athletic director bernard muirthat is something to think about later there is a more immediate task for the fifthyear senior who a of thursday morning had won a national invitation tournament championship but had yet to play in an ncaa tournament gameive been happy with what i came for travis said recently and what i really came for is marchmarc stein

something thats happening in our game thats indescribable to his data thats getting u over the hump miller added thats toughness thats the ability to win close game the proudest i ever am a a coach is when we have an awful shooting game or we have an awful offensive game and thing dont go our way and we still find a way because our team wa able to dig down and figure out a way to get over the

and metacognition how we think about our thinking said that while confidence or the lack of it is a fundamental element of athletic competition it is often misplacedthe human mind doesnt rely on big

jeremy lin leave town it wa the final indignity after year of atrocious basketball i dumped my knicks season ticket and adopted the fledgling club whose arena had just risen over my brooklyn

suffering even when my family traded brooklyn for london in we remained net fansthis happily coincided with another development the net bucked the conventional wisdom that new york fan will not accept

advertisementsupported byby howard megdalalbany to protest the absence of his star player napheesa collier from the recent list of finalist for the naismith trophy awarded annually to the country best college basketball player the uconn woman coach geno auriemma invoked james naismith himselfdr naismith is rolling over in his grave auriemma said this week he is he never envisioned that somebody that good would be left off his listi feel bad for her he said of collier if she played at any other school shed be the frontrunner with the number she put up but she play at connecticut so what are you going to doauriemmas theory that collier omission is part of a backlash to a generation of uconn dominance in woman basketball is bolstered by a series of decision made this month the husky despite a regularseason record and a win over the defending national champion notre dame received a no seed in this year ncaa tournament it wa the first time since the husky were not a top seed in a regionbut it wa the rejection of collier from the naismith trophy final four asia durr of louisville megan gustafson of iowa sabrina ionescu of oregon and arike ogunbowale of notre dame and a similar snub for the wade trophy the national player of the year award given by the woman basketball coach association that surprised auriemma and othersrebecca lobo the former uconn star and current espn commentator is a past winner of both award she is also a naismith voter and said she had collier on her ballot when asked whom she considered the best player in the country to be lobo said gustafson ha had the best season i think but that doesnt make her the best in the countryby virtually every measure imaginable a case can be made that that honor belongs to collier a senior from ofallon mo in win share for instance the advanced metric that seek to quantify the number of win a player produce for her team collier rank just ahead of gustafson for the most valuable player in the country this season it is this kind of catchall statistic collier defender argue that best express her value because while her uconn statistic are impressive point and rebound a game she doe not lead the nation in any individual categoryindeed it could be that collier versatility hurt her with some voter even though it make her so important to connecticut which face louisville a no seed in the ncaa tournament albany region final on sunday a one wnba general manager put it collier is the most turnkey of the top prospect in the draft which will be held on april gustafson is the oldschool post scorer ionescu is the playmaking point guard durr and ogunbowale are the twoway shooting guardscollier she doe everything shes foot and auriemma us her to guard opposing center at time sends her out to faceguard wing and even some guard despite this steady diet of the best that opponent can throw at uconn she rank nd out of qualified player in defensive point per possession allowed at ahead of every player on the naismith and wade award list she ha posted a steal percentage above two and a block rate of nearly percentand she ha done all this at the defensive end while ranking second in the country to gustafson in offensive point per possession with an assist percentage more befitting a point guard a rebound rate th in the country among division i player and a turnover percentage of only percent reflecting a decisionmaking process that ha wnba team salivating over the chance to add her one frontoffice executive labeled her the best bigger player in the draftcollier did not hide her surprise over the snub but said she would continue to strive to achieve goal that are measurable and within her controlyeah i thought it wa crazy but i dont need people voting to tell me im the best collier said i know i am kobe bryant only won one mvp so that show the best player doesnt always win and to be honest right now im focused on something they cant vote on which is winning a national championshiplouisville coach jeff walz echoed his friend auriemmas incredulity at the lack of respect for collieryeah im surprised walz said ive always been a huge fan of napheesas game i watched her in high school a ton shes really impressivewalz ha an elite player of his own in durr and her matchup against collier on sunday could serve either a affirmation of durrs place on the naismith and wade list or a more evidence that collier belongs therebut to auriemma the fact that uconn is even in a position to play in such a game wa largely because of colliercan you imagine how many game wed win if we didnt have her auriemma said adding i mean you talk about who mean a lot to their team i dont know anybody who mean more to their team anywhere in the country than phee i cant imaginean earlier

an aching question when boeheim is ready to step down will hopkins return to upstate new yorkthe answer is anyones guesshopkins call boeheim his mentor but the connection is deeper than that he describes their bond a one between a wise father and an eagertoplease son it began year ago when hopkins left southern california to play at syracuse unheralded and overlooked compared with his bluechip teammatesboeheim ha said he thought hopkins might never be more than a role player hopkins instead blossomed into a hustling starter who wa called the human bruise for his will to sacrifice his body on defense and dive for loose ball he became one of boeheims favoritesnot long after graduating in hopkins returned to syracuse to try coaching the year turned hopkins became boeheims top assistant and ace recruiter he helped reel in a significant chunk of syracuse national championship teamthen came the orange selfimposed a postseason ban in response to an ncaa investigation boeheim

coaching a team of his ownone possibility wa washington when it athletic director jennifer cohen flew to syracuse to interview him she got a jolt of his patented energy right there a were meeting she said he talking about his vision for what he can do and he so excited that he drop down to the ground and start doing pushupslets just put it this way it wa something id never seen before in that setting but it wa also perfect it showed the hunger he ha the edge the energyhopkins took over the husky in march without an exploratory visit to the campus it just felt right he said almost at a spiritual level he had deep seattle root his mother wa born in the area his father grew up a mile from campus and attended washington cousin lived nearby even his favorite band pearl jam hail from seattlein their first season under hopkins the husky discovered cohesion particularly a they unfurled a syracuseinspired zone defense and because his excitement is contagious fan began returning

siblingslisten to the argument podcast every thursday morning with ross douthat michelle goldberg and david leonhardtcollege sport bring people a lot of joy a one of my college roommate texted me last week a a way of objecting to my recent criticism of sport im happier when our basketball team is good he got a point sport create shared experience in a way that few other activity in this country dothis communal function mean that college have a good reason to treat some athlete differently from most other applicant yes the college should make sure theyre admitting only athlete with the academic preparation to graduate but i understand why the basketball player representing the university of minnesota today dont necessarily need the same academic qualification a the student oboist or journalist at minnesota those athlete bring something to the campus that few other student canwhy in the worldbut it important to remember something else most college sport dont look anything like basketball they dont bring a lot of people together their crowd are small they dont have many spillover benefit for the other part of a university they exist largely for the benefit of the athlete themselves which make them not so different from many other extracurricular activitiesand these other sport are often disproportionately played by white relatively welloff student they dont add much diversity to a campus only percent of male college lacrosse player are black a justin wolfers of the university of michigan ha noted only percent of fencer are in golf the share is percent in water polo it percentyet college treat athlete in these sport a an entirely different specie of applicant the athlete dont need to have nearly a strong application a other studentsbecause so many of these sport exist the share of athlete at some college is shockingly high roughly percent or onefifth of the entering class at the ivy league university and the leading small liberal art college are recruited athlete jonathan cole a top former official at columbia university and before that a college athlete ha written why in the world are the school using up percent of their slot on recruited athlete the answer cole explains is that sport have become a kind of arm racein a recent newsletter i mentioned that about one in five student at williams college in western massachusetts wa an athlete according to an outside estimate that turn out to be wrong and too conservative williams is on the high end of the distribution with about percent of student being recruited athlete according to the collegecole is right that this situation doesnt make any sense i am fully aware that fencer golfer water polo player and other athlete work extremely hard but so do many other student who participate in other extracurricular activity and have superior academic record those other student are often rejected to make room for the athlete the problem is the special treatment that so many athlete are receivingin a better system most college would substantially shrink the number of athlete they recruit each would keep a modest number of sport split equally between men and woman for which they would recruit athlete and still give huge admission bonus these wouldnt be the only team that college fielded but the other sport would follow a classic scholarathlete model the member of the team would no longer receive extraspecial treatment in the admission process they would be student who happened to be athlete and they would compete with other team filled with similar athletesis

last season and byrd knew that ja morant then a freshman wa a perfectly solid playerbut then byrd and his staff started getting the wordofmouth from preseason workout byrd said friday in a telephone interview morant wa not just solid he wa the best player in the league they heard in fact after the season he would be an nba draft pick make that an nba lottery pickit wa hard to believe byrd said because he wa the third wheel on that team at best reallyhe just wa a guy byrd added you knew you didnt want him in the open floor on the break you knew he could see the floor and pas the ball but we went under all his strong screen that is on pickandrolls belmont dared morant to shootnow byrd is a believer along with everyone else and not just because morant led murray state to the conference championship over belmont this month morant ha emerged a college basketball most exciting player this side of duke zion williamson the transcendent freshman who may well turn out to be the only player taken ahead of morant in june nba draft morant is eighth in division i in scoring with point a game and first in assist with on thursday morant led the thseeded racer to an thrashing of fifthseeded marquette in hartford in the ncaa tournament first round contributing point rebound and assist the first men tournament tripledouble since he followed that with point rebound and assist in a loss to no florida state on saturdayeven in a loss morant wa the game leading scorermorants coach and teammate his firmest backer and closest watcher acknowledge that they were not quite prepared for this it is a if morant had received magic bean or sold his soul to the devil down at the crossroadswe didnt see the jump he had this year coming the murray state assistant coach casey long said but we knew the work ethic he put in and his ability that allowed him to make the jumpjonathan stark who won conference playeroftheyear honor on last year murray state team and is now on an nba development league roster said in an interview i knew he wa going to have the key to the ignition i knew he wa going to be an nba player i knew he wa going to go first roundno and stark added referring to predicted draft position i honestly didnt know about thata sudden rise like morants is not supposed to happen in the very best high school player are spotted early and gravitate to the top program which they treat a the basketball equivalent of a twohour airport layover on their way to their preferred even expected destination the nbaif a expected morant is taken with a topthree pick he will be the first american who wa not a freshman so honored since and the first from a midmajor university since memphis derrick rose in the college basketball establishment probably took longer to catch up to morants ability because he wa underrecruited morant whose youtube highlight reel are on hoop fanatic heavy rotation said friday that he wa under six foot tall a recently a his senior year of high school he is now listed at foot and that he could not reliably dunk the ball until he wa nearly in collegethis also explains what to morants coach matt mcmahon wa an underrated freshman season one in which morant averaged point assist and rebound per game number that mcmahon compared to college season of future nba star like anfernee hardaway and jason kiddi think he did take a leap but i think he did not receive enough credit for the terrific freshman year that he did have mcmahon saidmorants evolution from his freshman to sophomore season wa neither exponential nor linear the murray state strength and conditioning coach zach whitman said morant is lanky listed at pound but whitman said he probably added pound since arriving at murray state campus in far western kentucky in over the summer said his teammate brion sanchious he dunked on one of my teammate and i thought yeah he heremorants shooting ha improved too with both his and point percentage upbut maybe most of all the explanation for morants remarkable improvement between two season wa the changing team dynamic around him and his willingness last season to sublimate his own number for the team sakein the senior stark and terrell miller jr the racer had two proven scorer last year they would go on to average nearly point a game combined and lead the racer to the ncaa tournament a morant accepted a role a the team third scoring option and shared point guard duty with the more experienced starklast year i just felt like i didnt have to take many shot morant saidhe wa more of a role player last year due to jonathan stark and terrell added shaq buchanan morants current backcourt partnerhe played the role great buchanan added and when the time came for him to be that leader and player we needed he stepped up and delivered for usmorant prepared for this task over the summer hitting the weight room and the court with redoubled ferocity according to teammate and coach he wa also selected to attend the cp elite guard camp a crash course in pointguarding that is connected to the nbas chris paulhe came back from cp camp and we started having pickup and workout and he wa scoring at such a high rate that we knew he wa going to be able to take a jump in that aspect of the game said long the assistant coachhis teammate devin gilmore pointed to an earlyseason defeat at alabama a evidence that morant had assumed a new role he scored point taking nearly half his team field goalshe know what need to be done to win the assistant coach tim kaine said last year we had two stud he knew they were the guy he got them the ball and put them in position where they were going to be successful this year he knew he needed to step up the scoringone final thing that helped morant this season might serve a an implicit rebuke of those college coach who have sought to win game by recruiting talented but green freshman experiencelast year when murray state lost to west virginia by point in the ncaa tournament first round morant had point assist and reboundsthis year he put on the show of the tournament first day and afterward dwyane wade tweeted about him while luka doncic and deaaron fox directmessaged him on

the world is just finding outbanghart began to sense that more people were becoming aware of her star player during a recent conversation with chris young the former major league pitcher who played basketball and baseball at princetonhe go id pay to watch two player in college basketball zion williamson and bella alarie banghart saidalmost every basketball fan know williamson duke top player and probably the nbas next top draft pick but alarie she is a foot junior who ha developed into a player capable of lifting the tiger to national prominence on saturday against cornell in the semifinal of the ivy league tournament she grabbed eight rebound and scored a gamehigh point shooting of from the field in a victory to advance to the finalobservers believe she ha a chance to do something no ivy league player ha done since allison feaster who graduated from harvard in represent the conference in an extended wnba careerthis development wa le a dedicated plan and more a series of serendipitous choice merged with hard work alarie a multitalented twoway player of the kind sought at the professional level did not tower over her peer when she wa growing up she remembers being only a bit taller than them but say she can not recall a time when she did not have a basketball in her handsher father mark a former duke and nba player set about making sure she could play at any positioni think a lot of it wa really focusing on my guard skill bella alarie said i think my dad knew that from a young age that developing skill early would really benefit me in the long run we didnt really know how tall i would be so im really lucky that i kept growingher slight build meant that during her high school career at national cathedral school in washington she drew interest from ivy league team including harvard and penn but did not get so much a a letter of interest from her father alma mater anything beyond playing in college wa not on her radar when she arrived at princetonin high school i never really thought of myself a someone who would achieve the thing i have so far in college alarie said and when i wa getting recruited i did really want to put an emphasis on getting a really wellrounded college experience the ivy league i wa really drawn to from the beginning princeton penn and harvard those were definitely the school it came down tothings began to change for alarie after she won ivy league freshman of the year honor then wa selected to play for usa basketball in the under fiba world cupto make that team that really proved to me that i could compete with some of the best in the country alarie said and against the best in the world at my age so i think that summer really boosted my confidence in myself a a player and also expanded my game and i learned how to play in another systemher coach took note of it and ha turned alarie into a true hybrid she ha been used more in the post after adding pound to her frame without forsaking her guard skill that make her an intriguing pro prospect for a league dominated by player like elena delle donne and breanna stewart who have size and the ability to play any positionopposing coach have noticed tooi love her tony bozzella the seton hall coach said alarie had point and rebound last year in a princeton win at seton hall reminds me of delle donne not a good yet but similar game obviously a great scorer in many way awesome rebounder and passer great vision supersmart a definite firstround pickthis season after missing princeton first nine game with a broken arm alarie is putting up number seldom seen at the school she set the ivy league singlegame scoring mark last month with a point outing against columbia and in the process became the only princeton player other than bill bradley to score at least entering this weekend ivy league tournament at yale alarie wa averaging point and rebound a game and shooting percent from the field with range extending beyond the arcon the defensive end according to synergy sport data she wa allowing opponent point per possession which ranked her th in the country among division i player with at least defensive possessionsaccordingly princeton wa without her entering the weekend the tiger were with alarie unfortunately for opponent after she broke her right arm she spent her recovery time working aggressively on going to her left making her even harder to stopwhile wnba team can not comment on alarie publicly scout and executive are tracking her a one put it shes on radar they have let her coach know it tooi talk to wnba coach all the time about her banghart said so certainly shes no secret to the wnbaprincetons program ha generated other pro talent blake dietrick the ivy league player of the year in went on to play for the atlanta dream last season leslie robinson whose father craig wa a twotime player of the year at princeton in the early s wa drafted by the liberty in the third round of last season wnba draftdietrick credited the success of the program a a whole i would not have had nearly a much wnba interest were it not for the success of my team and our season she said referring to princeton regularseason record in but she also credited her coach for working to improve the player within the team context and with an eye on longterm successto banghart it wa no different from the way she would treat any other highachieving princeton studentif someone interested in finance i connect them to the people they think they can learn from banghart said with bella it the same thing the more positionless she can be the better she can be there an eye on helping her at princeton and there an eye on being the best pro she can be at what she chooses so im thinking big picture with her because she deserves it shes earned

matchup of team that rely on a throwback style of play methodical offense lunchpail defense and roster long on experiencewith a pair of pulverizing defense and coach who demanded diligent shot selection the game began in sync with expectation a something that looked like three dribble and a cloud of sawdust five minute in that had produced a baseball score in favor of texas tech and it took the red raider more than seven minute to score their first field goalbut the game quickly morphed into one for the age a the team traded shot after shot down the stretch and into overtime until the red raider could deliver no moreevery time i thought we had it they made a shot or made a play texas tech matt mooney said afterward barely audible and staring at the ground a he sat at his locker it wa a battle we threw a punch they threw a punch they came right back at u every timeit wa fitting that a deandre hunter pointer from the corner with minute second left in overtime put the cavalier

regulation play on monday hunter took a pas from jerome who had penetrated into the lane and knocked down a tying pointer from the corner in front of the virginia benchit wa a particularly crushing shot for texas techthe red raider had crept back from a point deficit midway through the second half and they did so without much help from tariq owen the starting forward who sprained his right ankle on saturday and then received roundtheclock treatment and a painkilling shot to try to get through the title game owen played just minutesstill when norense odiase sank two free throw with second left to put texas tech ahead by the red raider were right where they wanted to be turning to their defense rated by kenpom a the best in the nationi thought we just needed one more stop odiase said we pride ourselves on getting stop like that i thought it wa overbut a jerome drove into the lane culver left hunter to help and mooney neglected to rotate off kihei clark the freshman guard who is a reluctant shooteri wa thinking i have to make this said hunter who missed seven of eight shot in the first half and scored point in the second thats exactly what i said in my head i shot it it felt good it wa on a line and it went intexas tech had been rescued to that point by brandone francis who scored point off the bench and by some heroic play from odiase down the stretch and though culver came alive offensively late scoring point and delivering five assist and three block he could not deliver quite enough he missed two shot in the final second of regulation the first with hunter contesting that would have delivered an unlikely title for texas tech which wa unranked at the start of the seasonhunter also had a hand in a pivotal defensive play in overtime knocking the ball away from davide moretti and out of bound with remaining and virginia clinging to a lead the official ruled that the ball had gone off hunter who raked moretti across the arm but the call wa overturned after a replay review and the ball went to virginiajerome made two foul shot with second left and virginia which made all of it free throw attempt in overtime never gave the ball back to texas tech

that game guy told him it wa not necessaryif you have a conflict try to hit it head on guy who scored point explained on sunday thats the only way youre going to get past it and thats something that

advertisementsupported byby kelly whitesidethe poet and the point guard have never met but they see the parallel in their craft the pushpull between creativity and pragmatism between daring and safebefore this season mikko harvey an awardwinning poet long enamored of the playing style of dangelo russell wondered if the net would ever find a place for their new point guard whose imaginative play can vacillate between the beautiful and the boneheadeddo you throw the nolook pas for beauty sake when a practical pas would dodo you write poetry or paint portrait when just about any other career is the more prudent choicerooting for dangelo seems like a vote for art and a vote for imagination and a vote for whimsy harvey said if thats the case whimsy is winning at russell will play in his first nba allstar game on sundayharvey began rooting for russell when they were at ohio state five year ago harvey a a graduate student russell a a freshman for the buckeye harvey fell in love with the artistry of the point guard playwatching russell is like seeing a skateboarder midair soaring through a series of dizzying flip and twist harvey said you hold your breath wondering whether or not he going to land itwhen told of the analogy russell nodded i can relate he said it risk versus reward i play freely almost with an edge taking what the defense give but also taking what i want and thats either a tough shot that go in or a tough pas that get through it can either be a turnover or an air balltheres a balance i think thats where my success ha come from finding that balance this season but for coach it can be hairpulling turning it over too many time or trying to make a home run pas or shot too many timesso far the risk is paying off russell ha become the leader of a team that ha exceeded expectation at the net have surpassed last season victory total with le than a third of the regularseason schedule remainingin his fourth season in the league russell his found success by staying true to his inner artist while operating within the net system through game he ha averaged career high in point assist field goal percentage point field goal percentage and free throw percentage there is a creative gene that he ha net coach kenny atkinson said artist drive you crazy sometimes because they want to keep expanding and there ha to be a discipline sometimes he get too creative his biggest strength can be a weakness but his creativity and our structure have become a good marriage the more ive gotten to know him the more i let him be more creative sure i can get upset at time but im going towards giving that kid more freedomthough russell crafty play have outweighed the knuckleheaded one this season there are time when atkinson want to pull out fistful of hair in october against new orleans with the net ahead by a point with second left russell glanced left knowing caris levert wa to his right his nolook pas sailed far beyond leverts reach and out of bound and the pelican went on to wini wasnt nolooking just to nolook russell said adding that he miscalculated the speed of the cut but i should have been lookingmore recently against boston with the net behind by atkinson sat russell for the final minute second even though the point guard had scored point in minute after russell loafed on two rebound attempt and turned the ball over twice atkinson pulled him for what he called a teachable momentafter the loss russell accepted responsibility without complaint a sign of his growth since coming to the netsrussells leadership skill now are mile from the immaturity that plagued his rookie season with the los angeles lakers who drafted him a the second overall pick in that year he made a secret recording of his teammate nick young admitting to cheating on his fiancée at the time the rapper iggy azalea the video became public young and azalea broke up and locker room dysfunction followed after two season the lakers traded russell to the netsdangelo is an excellent player magic johnson the lakers president told reporter in after introducing russell replacement lonzo ball he ha the talent to be an allstar we want to thank him for what he did for u but what i needed wa a leader i needed somebody also that can make the other player better and also that player want to play withrussell ha become precisely what johnson desired an allstar a leader and someone who make those around him betterhe make it fun to play because he make game a lot easier forward joe harris said he a cerebral player if someone doesnt get a touch he thinking about how to get them in rhythmon a recent trip while the rest of the team wa napping on the plane atkinson tapped russell on the shoulder and told him that he had been named an allstar russell would be a reserve replacing the injured victor oladipo russell held back tearsgoing into the season i dont think anyone myself included thought id be an allstar russell said i feel like what ive been through in the league ive learned when you focus and buy into your craft all of a sudden you look up and good thing happenand with the good come something else pressurelike most net fan harvey the poet is thrilled with the team success but also filled with othershoedrop anxiety a the net inch closer to a playoff spot what if the trap door open and they fall closer to the cellar or what if russell regresseseven when thing are going well im so used to them falling apart said harvey who previously lived in brooklyn where he taught creative writing and worked a an editorial fellow at poet writer magazinethe poet fandom left the confines of his imagination last year when in an interview with a canadian literary blog he wa asked to describe his secret internet obsession he confessed i watch his game read think piece about him on the netsdaily fan website keep up with his instagram etc he occasionally appears in my dreamsif finding a balance between the daring play and the restrained one is what russell ha learned this season harvey of course see a parallel to poetryits not easy to blend his kind of unpredictable energy into a set system harvey said and yet thats one of the beautiful challenge of artmaking finding way to innovate within structure a poem can be wildly inventive even while following an thcentury rhyme scheme his creativity really shine when he ha a good system to either fall back on or react against his imagination ha become much more coherentharvey relies on an essay the figure a poem make by robert frost to describe the creative process it take hard work to become a great artist but it also requires something mysterious and intuitivelike a piece of ice on a hot stove the poem must ride on it own melting frost wrote a poem may be worked over once it is in being but may not be worried into being it most precious quality will remain it having run itself and carried away the poet with it read it a hundred time it will forever keep it freshness a a petal keep it fragrance it can never lose it sense of a meaning that once unfolded by surprise a it wentwhen the word are read to russell his eye grow wide i went to robert frost middle school said russell who is from louisville ky thats fascinating i like the way he did that i get itjust a far a the mental process go when you put word in a poem you have to think how many outcome the reader will come up with like robert frost said it never get old you can read it a hundred time and it keep it freshness you can take that over to basketball your mind can take your game to so many different level it totally relatesadvertisement

sidelined him at the start of the season knox play took off in december when he averaged point and wa named the eastern conference rookie of the monthknox hit the rookie wall beginning in midjanuary with a game stretch in which he shot percent from the field and from beyond the point arc the slump started soon after he scored point his highest total in the nba during a game against the philadelphia ersshortly before that knox had said that he wa still learning how to adjust to the demand of the long nba schedule and it minute game compared with a minute in college and aau ballits totally different he said in late december eight minute doesnt seem like a lot but it really is thats a whole quarter almost eight minute is a long time in basketballto improve his fitness knox did extra sprint after practice and spent more time on the treadmill running spurt of minute with the last two a fast a he couldat various point in the season fizdale ha brought in former knicks great like bernard king patrick ewing bill bradley and walt frazier to speak to his young struggling team the coach who wa a miami heat assistant coach when james played for them also made a point of introducing knox to the lakers star after sunday gameking who wa with the knicks for five season in the mids and wa known for his seemingly unstoppable baseline turnaround jump shot ha focused especially on mentoring knoxin between their meeting early in the season knox studied online video highlight from king careerhe help my game every time i talk to him knox said he kind of like me a wing that get to the basket love transition he kind of reminds me of myselfperhaps the other way around rookknox said he had sought out his own tutor a well connecting with chris bosh grant hill jalen rose carmelo anthony and former kentucky player for bit of advice during the trying momentsafter monday night loss in toronto the knicks had game left in the season all of them meaningless except for their effect on the draft the three team with the lowest win total will each have a percent of landing the no selection in june which presumably will be the duke freshman zion williamsonthe knicks who have the worst record in the league are expected to lose their way into one of those slot even after that uplifting win against the lakers which ended when the knicks mario hezonja blocked a shot by james in the waning secondswe had a lot of ups and down this season knox said afterward it wa bigtime win the first sweep of the season it just a great way to win in the garden in the last second against one of the best player to ever play the game and we get a defensive stop with the crowd standing up yellingat a critical stretch in the fourth quarter the knicks had it three rookie on the court knox center mitchell robinson guard allonzo trier plus guard kadeem allen who wa just called up from the westchester developmental team and forward lance thomas the longesttenured knicktheres a process that need to happen and ours is growth making sure the young guy are getting the experience they need in order to be good in this league thomas said a lot of young guy dont get to play especially extended minute in their first year it a learning experience for young guy our goal is to fasttrack themknox is sixth in the league among rookie in minute played per game at despite shooting a subpar percent from the field and struggling with weakside defense he is averaging point with reboundseven so fizdale ha never considered sending knox to westchester to work on his game in the anonymity of the g league because our team wa already like a glorified g league team fizdale told reporter last week because his rookie played substantial minute all season he said he thought it wa better for them to take their knock against the bestsuch a james on sunday and toronto kawhi leonard on mondaywelcome to the league kid fizdale said this is what it about this is why i wanted him in this take those lump now later on in his career no one will remember this stuff when he is the guy beating up on kid this is all good for himadvertisement

steinthe arrival of lebron james a their latest in a succession of superstar import wa supposed to halt the longest period of suffering in the los angeles lakers california historywhat james and the lakers have experienced instead will be remembered a the most disappointing season of james career because it will extend a stubborn playoff drought that ha flummoxed the nbas most glamorous franchisenot even james presence could prevent a sixth straight missed postseason for the new lakers who are mere day from being mathematically eliminated from the playoff entering sunday visit to madison square garden to face the knicks the lakers remember missed the playoff only four time in their first season after relocating from minneapolis in the seasonso much for hollywood fairy

wa signing a fouryear million contract with the lakersyet the ensuing celebration did not last even hourson july golden state boldly swiped some of the lakers thunder by signing the former allstar big

summer of and their planned pursuit of an allstar sidekick for jamesthe problem magic johnson and rob pelinka the lakers nascent frontoffice power duo signed a slew of nonshooters and shall we say mercurial personality who a a group prompted instant secondguessingthe lakers countered the skepticism by insisting that playmaker and playofftested veteran rather than shooting specialist who could open up space on the floor would ease lebrons burden and potentially even match up well with the mighty warrior only to see their signees do little to hush the toldyouso crowd javale mcgee the veteran

that this wa not going to be the usual lebron season when a fight broke out between a number of lakers and houston rocket in james first home game at staple centerand the tension never really let

the meeting or any detail to leak to the news medium but they promptly did in the nosecrets world of the nbajohnson immediately tried to play down suggestion that walton job wa already in jeopardy in an interview with the los angeles time but he would not go further than proclaiming that walton wa going to finish the season unless something drastic happens which it wontwalton is certainly not blameless in the lakers struggle his lineup rotation and responsibility for la worrisome drop to no leaguewide in offensive efficiency have routinely been questioned management furthermore is said to be dismayed by walton refusal to hire a seasoned former head coach a his top assistant something young coach walton is frequently doyet the public nature of the heat walton took from his own front office made johnson look impatient and worse ramped up the pressure on everyone in the lakers locker room especially the coach before they even made it to thanksgiving with two year left on a fiveyear deal walton is widely expected to be shoved out of his toasty seat for good at season endwhat can be classified a the best day of the lakers season if you only considered the box score is also bound to be remembered a this season low pointthe lakers went to oakland on christmas day for a game in the most anticipated television time slot on the regularseason calendar and throttled the twotime defending champion warrior the rout capped an surge that nudged la record to good for a promising fourth in the dauntingly deep western conferencebut james strained his left groin a he stretched to retrieve a loose ball in the third quarter the lakers gradually pulled away without him and james optimistically posted to twitter the next day about how he dodged a bullet with a backinnotime hashtag but the injury turned out to be the most serious he had ever sustainedjames eventually missed game no previous injury had ever sidelined him longer than the eight game he lost to a back injury in the lakers went without james and even accounting for all of their misstep before and after lebron went down can rightly point to suddenly losing their star a the biggest blow to the team playoff hopesit remains unclear how backinnotime turned into six week on the sideline for james an inevitability given his age the byproduct of the lakers playing at a much faster pace than lebrons cleveland team a freak occurrencemaybe it wa a combination of all those factorswhats clear though is that the lakers overall poor health ha consistently hurt themthe lakers for starter are since jan when lonzo ball who had begun to impress james a their starting point guard sustained a serious ankle injury and there moretyson chandler the veteran center who made such an impact defensively after joining the team nov is dealing with a neck ailment josh hart the promising secondyear guard ha been plagued by tendinitis in his left knee for month and brandon ingram the swingman with tantalizing potential a a

forward anthony davis trade request going public on jan and the league feb trade deadline but that surely felt like an eternity for the lakers quartet of starlet ingram ball hart and kyle kuzmaespecially since the fallout is continuingfrom the minute james arrived in hollywood after the lakers made unsuccessful trade run at paul george and kawhi leonard it wa known that the team would try to trade for davis which meant all four of la top young player were destined to hear their name in trade speculation yet the leaguewide consensus wa that davis would not be made available until at least the offseason theoretically giving the starlet an opportunity to build something with james and maybe even change management mind about looking externally for lebrons superstar sidekickbut davis trade request changed everything rich paul lebrons agent and longtime friend became davis agent in september and wa widely perceived to have made the trade request on davis behalf to get him to los angeles a seemingly ceaseless stream of leaked lakers offer thereafter irreparably fractured the locker room no matter how hard paul pushed back against that narrativenor can the team fully move on from the trade drama because everyone know the front office will be back on the phone with new orleans soon trying to beat out the boston celtic package for davis once the pelican start fielding offer

the value of such blood work is overstated dallas lean heavily on orrecos team of consultant and their assessment of how to maximize playerreadinessall the thing nba team talk about player minute their load their tracking data their camera data all of that is external data used to try to predict whats going on internally said casey smith the head of dallas athletic training staff what were doing is trying to get a little bit of a look at whats actually going on internallydallas is one of just two nba team along with the knicks to hire orreco which proposes customized remedy to combat fatigue and try to identify increased risk for injury and illness by obtaining a range of data from player blood and feeding it into machinelearning programstaking cue from orrecos finding smith and jeremy holsopple the maverick athletic performance director tailor an individualized mix of training rest and recovery for each of dallas player the maverick owner mark cuban said the team pay orreco nearly per yearno maverick ha embraced this process more than barea who understands all too well that fatigued player face an increased risk of softtissue injuriestwo season ago amid worrisome

because regulating how team use biometrics and the data such research produce specifically whether the data belongs to the team player or the league itself remains an evolving point of concern throughout the nba a a safeguard amid the rise of wearable technology in practice session league policy threatens fine of up to per team for the misuse of biometric datayet smith insists that the collaboration with orreco ha improved the maverick ability to track the onset of illness and keep player more available for game in the season according to data maintained by instreetclothescom a website that track injury in the nba dallas player missed only four game due to illness le than half the league average of the maverick then lost a leaguelow zero game to illness last season when the

for the chicago white sox who also worked with the chicago bull said he would maintain a healthy level of skepticism about orrecos work until it reveals more about the biomarkers it study and the data being gatheredi would be cautious and say it investigational romeo said it a very interesting area of research and we applaud the effort that theyre making but at this time nothing supplants outstanding coach and trainer that can do a visual analysis and understand their athlete from the traditional method to know whether theyre training too hard or too littleat some point romeo said of

the american medical society for sport medicine i think this is a researchbased tool at this point in time but i dont think it ready for prime time what theyre doing is something that in year from now we may say wow this is absolutely great informationwe cant say that right now but what theyre doing is trying to put some science behind recommendation and i think thats very admirabledespite such skepticism cuban remains one of the biggest proponent of orrecos work after watching an interview in which the openly datahungry cuban discussed his growing fascination with artificial intelligence moore wrote to cuban before the season with a pitch that orreco could optimize performance accelerate recovery and prolong career by using highend computing to find pattern in the dataour job is to

his body looking almost sorry that he had attempted the shotthe block wa robinson eighth of the game setting a knicks rookie record which he stretched to nine block by the end of the night but beyond the block impact in the moment the play illustrated the yearolds approach to this season the perception may be that the knicks are tanking in hope of drafting duke zion williamson but for robinson any shot an opponent take is a chance for him to get a block and he is not going to be cheated out of any of them even if the shooter is beyond the point line a a result a mostly irrelevant team ha become

cavalier guard matthew dellavedova got the ball with a clean look at the basket from point range a he prepared to shoot he noticed robinson a few foot in front of him with the rookie lowering his shoulder slightly a he prepared to leap dellavedova immediately thought better of trying his luck and passed the ball instead a few second later on the same possession robinson got his block anyway swatting away a layup attempt from marquese chrissa rare preptopro nba player a a result of his complicated withdrawal from western kentucky university robinson ha been limited to minute a game a he

robinson is nothing short of stunning at percentbasketball reference ha tracked block percentage back to the season and the topfour season among player with or more block belong to manute bol the foot

finish a season with a block percentage higher than rim protection luminary such a serge ibaka mark eaton and dikembe mutombo all fell short of that mark in their best season robinson who ha quickly become a fan favorite belief he is just getting started he wa asked recently how many shot he could block a game if the team let him play minute a night probably around six he said i feel like i can get like sixthe nba season record for block per game is set by eaton in yet robinson boast doe not seem all that farfetched largely because of his unusual ability to block shot along the perimeter a well a under the baskethis potential is crazy emmanuel mudiay the knicks guard told reporter before thursday game he probably the best shotblocker i ever played with in my life in my opinion he the best shotblocker in the leaguefizdale ha said that robinson confidence and execution have improved since the team acquired deandre jordan to serve a his mentor the number back that up a robinson ha

filip peraić needed a career boost he found one by drawing harden the houston rocket guard in profile over and over and over againcreditcreditfilip peraićsupported byby benjamin hoffmanfilip peraić wa in a rut a freelance illustrator bored of his contract work he had hoped to reignite his love of art through a longterm personal projectit made sense that peraić who is from the basketballobsessed city of zadar croatia would come up with a project related to the nba but instead of taking a broad look at his favorite player or honoring his country many nba star peraić decided to do something more specific remarkably so his project would consist entirely of portrait of james hardens head in profile from the right side of the houston rocket star facesuddenly harden who is known for his distinctive beard existed in portrait form a a tribute to jackson pollock in one of peraićs work and a a tribute to wassily kandinsky in another there wa one in the style of a medical illustration and another that wa a map of the fictional country of hardenia his beard became a giant whale and it took on the distinctive curl of a greek philosopher in one particularly disturbing image hardens face wa replicated with human hair in all peraićs project which came to be known a james harden illustrated had image each one seemingly more bizarre than the previous onethe best portrait are when i surprise myself peraić said in a telephone interview im thinking about james hardens head constantly it my passion projectwith harden in the middle of a remarkable season in which he is almost certain to finish with the highest scoring average of any player in nba history besides wilt chamberlain and michael jordan peraić is set to release another batch of the illustration the first wa posted thursday and there will be one released each week for the next seven week thus carrying peraićs follower into the playoffson tuesday in hope of showcasing the existing work in advance of the new batch peraić tweeted out a thread of the original image which were completed from to the thread caught fire and wa shared and favorited thousand of timesperaić said the attention the post received wa gratifying but he wa especially excited by certain people who noticed themhe referred to a few journalist who shared the post then mentioned two people who favorited the thread daryl morey the general manager of the rocket and kirk goldsberry a former san antonio spur executive thats really cool because a an nba geek i follow these people constantly peraić said to see them reacting to my work is really rewardingthen there wa harden he wa once interviewed on tnt with a poster of peraićs portrait behind him but other than that peraić did not know how harden felt about the work that changed wednesday afternoon harden tweeted six of the image reacting to each with emoji yo filiperaic harden wrote in the first of the series of tweet these are dopebeyond rubbing elbow online with his nba hero peraić ha experienced tangible career benefit from the project recently he worked on a series of image for the singersongwriter leon bridge and while the image may not have hardens beard in them they are clearly in the same vein a the harden projectthe rut he had found himself in careerwise it seemed had created an opportunityi started this project just for my own pleasure and to try something else because i wasnt satisfied with the kind of work i wa getting peraić said now art director come up to me and say we want this kind of james harden portraitamusingly enough considering how much time peraić spends thinking about harden the rocket guard is not and ha never been the illustrator favorite player he mentioned living near the city in croatia where drazen petrovic the hall of famer grew up and said he had always preferred manu ginobili and kobe bryant over hardenpeople think that im obsessed with james harden and thats really not the case he said i just wanted to pick someone that had an interesting face that wa easily recognizableof the original batch of portrait peraić said his favorite were one comprising a single line and another in which hardens profile had morphed into a thermal image of an approaching hurricanei like repetition and im a bit stubborn he said when asked how he could keep coming back to the same image when i made a couple of them i thought this is really interesting it a challenge for methe image can take anywhere from a few hour to a few day to complete with one in which hardens profile wa recreated using only flower and other vegetation representing the highwater mark for effort so far the project requires enough time that it ha regularly run up against peraićs contract work which forced the recent pause in his output he acknowledged that of the eight work planned for the new batch only six are complete so farwhen he finish the final two that will bring the project to portrait until the next onei feel that this is a neverending project peraić said maybe if james harden shave his beard that would be the endbenjamin hoffman is a senior staff editor and regular contributor to the keeping score column in sport he

advertisementsupported bykeeping scorejamess first season with the lakers ha been disappointing but passing his idol in career scoring go beyond winning and losingby benjamin hoffmanthere wa no instagram post celebrating the achievement in advance this time there wa relatively little buildup from the news medium it wa an event that might have dominated the news cycle in year past but when lebron james passed michael jordan on the nbas career scoring list on wednesday night it wa a triumph that somehow had been reduced to a footnotejames came into the los angeles lakers game against the denver nugget needing point to surpass jordan for fourth place on the career list with minute second remaining in the second quarter he managed to force his way to the basket for a layup giving him point for the game and for his career for good measure he wa fouled on the play after a short stoppage to acknowledge the moment play resumed a the lakers clinging to the last shred of their playoff hope tried their best to overcome a huge early deficit at home against a heavily favored opponentlebron pass michael jordan on alltime scoring list pictwittercomgtaovqmrzthe lakers led by an unlikely group of bench player did make a run at denver reducing a point deficit at halftime to point with left in the fourth quarter but the nugget regained their footing and ran away with a victory spoiling a night in which james contributed point rebound and assist looking far more energized on both end of the court than he had in recent week and finishing the night with his career point total up to james who ha taken the brunt of the criticism for the lakers failing in a difficult first year in los angeles had acknowledged the pending accomplishment in a tweet shortly before the game but wa measured when discussing it with reporter earlier in the dayi take all accomplishment a they come he said any time im in the breath with any other great and obviously mj being the guy that i looked up to my whole life the guy i admired a a kid i think it going to be pretty cooljordan who owns the charlotte hornet issued a brief statement on thursday saying i want to congratulate lebron on achieving another great milestone during his amazing career the statement wa notable mostly for being far more succinct than the one he issued when kobe bryant passed him on the career scoring list in one would hardly have guessed from either man word that the greatest current basketball player had just surpassed his idol in their sport signature statistic the inability for james to truly celebrate the moment wa yet another indignity in a season full of themit wa a little more than a year ago when james had seemingly settled into a groove he scored his th point a feat he congratulated himself about on instagram hour before he actually accomplished it with that hurdle cleared and with recent championship run in miami and cleveland under his belt his march toward challenging jordan then bryant then karl malone and maybe even kareem abduljabbar the nbas career scoring leader seemed a if it would come without the criticism that had followed him earlier in his careera decision a loaded word when it come to james to move to an illprepared lakers team in the offseason ha changed the calculus altogether the team wa predicted by most to struggle to make the playoff in the west thanks to it collection of tooyoung player and veteran who do not complement james nevertheless many have labeled the year a disappointment by virtue of the team struggle despite having james a player whose presence ha seemingly guaranteed a final appearance for close to a decadeas a result james and the people around him have not been able to take much joy in his accomplishment just last week he passed andre miller to move into th place in career assist thus making him the only player currently in the top in both career point and assist that feat it had been temporarily attained by only a handful of other player going back to the day of bob cousy wa met with a collective shrugit is a reality of james life that he acknowledged on wednesdayi havent really appreciated anything ive been able to accomplish because im so engulfed in whats next he said how i can continue to get better how i can help this franchise get back to where it need to bean occasional season of missing the playoff is not unusual for most player even the great one but to capture how truly rare it would be for a jamesled team consider that he ha played doubledigit playoff game in each of the last year he ha appeared in nine nba final winning three and a a result his career ranking among playoff performer come off a outrageous even for someone a accomplished a james those ranking almost certainly will not improve this year but among the more interesting aspect of james current predicament is the opinion among many lakers fan that the team struggle have resulted in james failing to live up to bryants legacy those criticism ignore the fact that the lakers current sixyear run of missing the playoff included three season in which bryant wa still with the team in fact when bryant passed jordan on the career scoring list in a feat considered a big enough deal at the time that a road game in minnesota wa stopped for several minute so the crowd could give him a standing ovation and the timberwolves owner could present him with the game ball the lakers were only and partially a result of a seasonending injury to bryant later in the year were on their way to a recordbut in one of the endless parallel between the career of jordan and james player who will be debated long after both are gone jordan who passed wilt chamberlain for no on the career scoring list in also found little joy in what should have been a huge accomplishment largely because his washington wizard were a team at the time the thing about stats is they define you when youre or year past the game jordan said when asked to sum up his feeling on the accomplishment while youre playing what matter is winsjames who wear no because of jordan put a wristband on his forearm because of jordan learned to shoot fadeaways because of jordan and pitch sneaker for nike just like jordan doe may want to heed that advice from jordan in term of coming back on his accomplishment later even if they have to be put aside for now the lakers could never win another game and james a player who still refuse to label himself a scorer will always have more point than jordan the player who served a his inspiration on a path to greatness i got ta carry it on to the next kid james said after the game finally letting his emotion truly show hopefully i can inspire the next kid like myselfan earlier version of this article misstated the time in

coachthe lakers said in a statement that walton and the team had mutually agreed to part way without elaborating the news came three day after magic johnson the team president for basketball operation made the surprise announcement that he wa resigning so he could devote more time to his business interestswalton wa in his third season with the lakers who were expected to vie for a playoff spot after signing lebron james a fourtime nba most valuable player to a fouryear million contract last july instead the lakers scuffled to a record after month of general dysfunction and momentumsapping injury they finished th in the western conference well out of playoff positionthe nbas postseason will start saturday but without the lakers whose postseason drought is now at six season not even the celebrated addition of james could salvage this one but he missed significant time with a groin injury and even when he wa on the court he appeared detached from his teammate a week of misery mountedthe lakers are fraught with problem when johnson announced that he wa quitting this week he indicated that he had been planning to fire walton and that he had the support of jeanie bus the team controlling owner to go forward with the move but then johnson resigned in part he said because he could not go through with affecting someone livelihoodhours later after the lakers had closed out their season with a loss to the portland trail blazer walton said that he wa looking forward to an eventful summer with the team in hope of making improvement now he is gone too though he may not be unemployed for longthe sacramento king immediately responded to friday news by reaching out to walton representative to arrange an interview for their coaching vacancy according to two people familiar with sacramento plan who were not authorized to discus them publicly walton is considered the frontrunner to replace dave joerger whom the king fired this weeksteve kerr the coach of the golden state warrior expressed his support for walton one of his former assistantsin this job a a coach in the nba you are percent dependent on your circumstance the strength of your organization the momentum unity kerr told reporter in oakland calif everything ha to be in good order because if it not a we have witnessed with the lakers then there going to be casualty and usually the coach is the first onehe added theyre losing one of the best human in the nba theyre losing a guy who know the game a well a anybody ive met theyre losing somebody who player believe inwalton the son of the hall of fame center bill walton wa working with an illconceived roster that lacked depth defense and perimeter shooting still the pressure wa on him before the season even began once the lakers got off to a slow start johnson chastised walton in a closeddoor meeting raising speculation that walton wa already on the hot seatquestions about walton job security persisted throughout the season a he shuffled rotation and lineup searching for solution that never materializedwalton refused to make excuse publicly he wa a voice of unwavering optimism amid a sea of discontent but it hardly helped that the lakers were troubled by injury especially at point guardthen there wa james who had been incredibly durable in his year career but during the lakers christmas day game against the warrior he limped off the court with a strained groin and missed the next game without him the lakers struggled the hope wa that they could regain their footing once he returned but he wa not the cureall anyone imagined the lakers continued to lose with james back in the lineup even though he said he had activated himself for a playoff pushit had become clear by then however that the lakers did not have any discernible chemistry especially after johnson and rob pelinka their general manager tried and failed to acquire the allstar center anthony davis from the new orleans pelican ahead of february trade deadline it wa no coincidence perhaps that davis and james shared an agent rich paul the lakers were willing to send the pelican several of their promising young player including kyle kuzma brandon ingram and lonzo ball but were rebuffed in their attempt to swing a blockbuster dealthe result wa a team that seemed distracted at best and fractured at worst before long the lakers were officially eliminated from playoff contention james did not dress for the final six game of the seasonwalton who spent most of his year nba playing career with the lakers winning two championship a a reserve forward wa hired a their coach in after two season a an assistant with the warrior in he began the season a the warrior interim coach while kerr recovered from debilitating back issue and guided the
