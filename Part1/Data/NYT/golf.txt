developmentgregory nathan the chief business officer for the national golf foundation a golf market research provider said that a building boom from to produced a flood of home at topquality golf course mostly in the united state but internationally toothere is still plenty of supply to spare and the competition among golf community to woo buyer is fierce he saidwhile interest in golf community home waned after the recession that is no longer the case said gregory daco the chief united state economist for oxford economics usathe global economy is stronger and people have more disposable income to spare which mean that theyre more apt to invest in secondary purchase like golf home he saidbut before buyer decide to live in such a community they should consider several factor here is advice on how to make an informed decision about buying a golf homeits all about the locationfirst and foremost even before looking at prospective property consider the destinationsyou should like the idea of living where youre looking said patrick melton a cofounder and managing partner of south street partner a private equity real estate investment firm based in charlotte nc and charleston sc the firm owns kiawah island club a golf community near charleston with residence and two golf coursesif youve spent time in and enjoy miami or spain costa del sol region both of which have an abundance of golf community for example seek out home in these area on the flip side if youre enamored of countryside golf community but dont particularly like being in remote setting look for a site thats in a suburb and close to a citymany consumer fall in love with a golf community and buy a home there mr melton said only to realize afterward that theyre not thrilled with the areaalso consider whether being near quality medical care an international airport noteworthy restaurant and an art and culture scene is a priorityyour home could tick all the box in term of what youre looking for but it may be an hour drive to a major grocery store or hospital which could be a hassle mr melton saidand dont forget about the weather some destination are too cold to play golf or spend time outdoors in winter or may have a rainy or hurricane season while others are almost too hot in summer said liz rowlinson editor of a place in the sun magazine a division of the britishbased realestate consulting brand of the same nameif you want to play golf yearround and want a home thats appealing to be in yearround you should look for a property located in a region with a stable climate save for maybe a few month she saidbut location also mean the exact position of your home m rowlinson saidliving right next to a green or fairway sound idyllic but early morning mower can be noisy sprinkler come on during the night and fastmoving golf ball landing in your pool is tiresome she saidthe bottom line is that if youre sensitive to noise the crack of tee shot drive is far louder than the murmur of greenside puttssimilarly you may like view across fairway but will you be happy with golfer staring into your home a they pas by a strategically placed line of bush can provide privacyif youre an avid golfer the number of other good course nearby should figure in too playing at your own club week after week may get dullideally youd want at least a few public course le than an hour drive from you so you have the option for some variety when you play m rowlinson saidfind an experienced brokermore often than not buyer interested in golf community usually dont work with broker who are well informed about the area theyre looking in said blake plumley the chief executive of capital pursuit a development consulting firm specializing in resort residential community when interviewing potential broker ask them how many property they have sold in the community ideally it should be severalalso inquire about three positive aspect and three drawback of living in those community your broker should be able to easily answer this mr plumley saidthe broker should personally know the golf club membership director the general manager the head golf pro and a few other key figure in the community you want a broker who can directly introduce you to these people mr plumley saidlook for key amenitiessuccessful golf community offer much more than golf so much that they most likely attract plenty of nongolfing resident m rowlinson saiddesirable amenity include a clubhouse with more than one social gathering space tennis court an outdoor pool with a grill area a highquality restaurant a casual dining option and a bar a familyfriendly club is also important the best community have a robust lineup of activity for child and family such a summer camp boating and hiking excursion pool day fun foodthemed dinner such a taco night and morethe more amenity a community ha the broader it appeal is making your home more sellable if you ever look to move mr melton saidunderstand financial commitmentsliving in a golf development come with additional cost that could include club due property tax and monthly maintenance fee these cost can vary greatly from one community to the next and while the home you are considering might be affordable the price of living in the community could be exorbitantalso some community ass their resident while others dont that mean that resident are billed for the cost of project such a a new health club or repairing the clubhouse leaky roof financially sound community have a healthy cash reserve to pay for such project the exact number varies depending on a community size and the scale of it amenity but according to mr plumley some community have no or limited money in reserve your broker will be able to give you that informationbe careful what you sign up for because you could unexpectedly be out a few thousand dollar at any given time he saidare you willing to play by the rulesall golf community have regulation that resident are expected to follow mr melton said that buyer should be sure to understand what these rule are and decide whether theyre comfortable abiding by themone of the more significant rule is whether all resident are required to be member of the golf club whether youre a golfer or not it may be a smarter move to live in a community where youre not required to be a member otherwise when you look to resell a potential buyer base will be more limitedand if you are interested in becoming a member know what you are signing up for if you ever move and need to give up your membership for example you may be required to pay due until someone can take it over which could take a few yearsi know of instance where member have had to pay due for five year after theyve moved away mr melton saidalso most community have design guideline and you want to make sure that the aesthetic match yours for example you most likely wont be allowed to build an art deco home in a community where all the property are built in a contemporary styleask if the golf course is protectedis there a chance of your community golf course closing so that home or other structure can be builtask your realestate agent to find out in some case a golf course is protected by it owner through a conservation easement or deed restriction stating that the land can never be anything but a course but some course are not protected which mean that the owner have the right to close themi wouldnt buy in community where the golf course isnt protected because your property ha the potential to lose percent or more of it value mr plumley saidplan to hang out for a whileits vital to spend a few day actually living at a community you are interested in mr plumley saidyou want to make sure that youre comfortable and like being surrounded by the people who will be your neighbor he saidmost community offer discounted stay for serious buyer who should take up the offer and play the golf course use the pool and dine in the restaurantswhile youre there be sure to interact with the staff a much a possible mr melton saidin good golf community many of the employee have been around for decade and you should definitely

in closing out his th pga tour victory this week mickelson wa a study in restraint after his birdie putt at the th hole dropped he picked the ball out of the hole a though he were retrieving a package from his front stoop it wa mickelsons second victory in nearly a year he won the world golf championship event in mexico city last march and his first on u soil in day since he captured the waste management phoenix openany victory is special at pebble beach a historic venue with personal resonance for mickelson and his family but he hope a more meaningful celebration on the th green awaits him in june for the th u open the only major tournament that mickelson ha not woncan he strike gold twice at pebble beach in the same year two men have proved it possible jack nicklaus in on his way to a sevenvictory season and tiger wood in when he won nine pga tour event nicklaus wa in his s in and wood in his s in both at the peak of their powersmickelson will turn on the final day of this year u open and a win would make him the oldest men major champion surpassing julius boros who wa when he won the pga championship mickelsons younger brother and caddie tim suggested people discount mickelsons chance at their perilhes won twice now in the last month tim mickelson said adding obviously it show he can win stillmickelsons game appears to be aging a well a did the bottle of romanéeconti wine that he drank from the claret jug after winning the british open he ha a second and a first in his last three start with a missed cut at the phoenix open sandwiched in between the resurgence of mickelson and the yearold wood ha made the men game infinitely more compellingi believe that if i play my best if tiger play his best it good enough to win on any week mickelson said adding i just think that both myself and tiger are going to have a really really good yearmickelson and wood both have found their way to the winner circle more recently than either jordan spieth or rory mcilroy have like mickelson spieth and mcilroy are each one major title from completing a career grand slam mcilroy will get his opportunity first at the master in april spieths turn will come next at the pga championship in mayand then the spotlight will settle like a laser beam on mickelson who played his first major a a pro at the u open at pebble beach he noted that this year marked the th anniversary of his maternal grandfather debut a a preteen caddie at pebble beach where he made cent a roundduring the greenside trophy presentation mickelson told the story of how his grandfather al santos who grew up in monterey calif dropped out of school in the fourth grade to help support his family and shortly thereafter found his way to the pebble beach caddie shackmickelson said his grandfather carried a silver dollar in his pocket while he worked and passed it down to mickelson who us it a a ball marker whenever he play here mickelson describes the place a special now but after he missed the cut at the u open he skipped the tour stop here in and i dont know i had a good big picture of the overall importance of the tournament to the game and what it provides and how much i love the place mickelson explained in playing pebble beach ha taught mickelson to take nothing for granted he wa trailing by two stroke after hole in but never got a chance to make a charge a inclement weather washed out the final two round two year later mickelson successfully outlasted mother nature and the field for his first pebble beach proam titlein the tournament first two round were played in stormy weather in february which rendered the course soft and the green slow and the final round took place under bright sunshine in august and the course wa fast and firm a it should be in june for the u open in winning his first proam title mickelson might have acquired the blueprint for realizing his last major goal in golfi have such great memory here mickelson said i would love to add to itbut mickelson added that he wouldnt allow himself to look any further ahead than the master he ha spent so long fixated on winning the u open but this week taught him the beauty that can reward those who see the big pictureadvertisement

that i cant really repeat here wood said then i went into the restroom and proceeded to say the same thing over and over to myself and then came out and i felt a lot betterwoods called it a grind and it wa until his tee shot on the par th hole almost went in it became a coronation on the final hole a roar echoed with each birdie and the inevitability of it all started to sink inthe crowd wa

treatmentperhaps wood believed the famous serenity of augusta national pristine ground could bring some tranquillity to his then rancorous life but he appeared only nervous and uneasyhis opening tee shot rocketed into the wood left of the first fairway and he marched off in haste after the uncommonly ugly outcomewoods had reason for feeling especially anxious a glut of security officer flanked him on every step including armed sheriff unarmed guard and plainclothes police officer the whirling of television news helicopter circling overhead provided a constant noisy soundtrack to his presenceworse a day earlier billy payne then the augusta national chairman had delivered a harsh rebuke saying wood did not live up to role model expectation and had disappointed all of u and more important our kid and our grandkidsall in all not a great day for the world topranked golfer who had won major golf championship and wa still expected to vault past the record jack nicklaus but the augusta national scene on tuesday found wood humbled and changed in way unimaginable from the master yes he is still chasing a th major championship but tellingly he seems le frantic about that pursuit than ever asked if he would have expected such a lengthy major drought wood calmly answered yeah i would say that i wouldnt have foreseen that for surehe thought he would win more he said adding but unfortunately i just didnt do itrepeatedly he acknowledged a new or is it rediscovered embrace of the sport fan he talked about the surging gallery that enveloped him on the concluding hole of last year tour championship when he won his first pga tour event in five year a triumph that seemed to eclipse the travail of four back operation and myriad offcourse embarrassmentsi had chill he said of that gallery on seven month agoit wa his th tour title and yet wood said of that victory i didnt know if i could ever get there again and lo and behold i got there againmeaningfully wood also freely revealed his vulnerability something that year ago happened about a often a he sixputted a greenqueried about the reliability of his putting wood insisted he wa still a strong putter but one with a problemthe hardest part is i just cant practice like i used to he said my back get sore i just cant log in the time that i used to and that go with every part of my gamethe invincible tiger wood wa not only admitting to a weakness he wa smiling about itit wa a little bit easier when i could work on everything he said with a grin but thats no longer the case you know i just cant do all the thing all the time anymorewoods now ranked th in the world maintains a belief in his chance this week he know the golf course better than any other top golfer in the field he is convinced of the mental fortitude provided by the momentum he gained last season when he held a finalround lead at the british open contended late in the pga championship and won the final event of the tour calendar this season in five event he ha had four top finishesmoreover wood credibly and palpably is no longer haunted by the most inglorious chapter of his past he ok with looking backward he know he made a lot of mistakesthis week he announced that at the master he would once again wear the collarless mock neck pullover he made famous in his prime he will don a version of it in all four round he said thats what he wore in the last time he won the mastersi thought it wa a pretty neat look back in the day he said on tuesday with a laughall these year later there wa little left to hidei wa probably in a little better shape back in those day he said but i won event wearing the mock ive always enjoyed wearing them and youll see it on thursdayadvertisement

mcilroy offered a historical reference a perspectivei guess ive become a lot more comfortable with the fact that im going to fail more time than i succeed at that certain conquest he said pointing out that abraham lincoln even lost some election he wound up being the president of the united state mcilroy said so ive still got a bit of timemcilroy know the select fraternity he would join if he added a master to the title he already won at the united state open british open and pga championship the full set of major ha been captured by only five men including jack nicklaus and tiger woodsalso this year jordan spieth can achieve a career grand slam at next month pga championship and phil mickelson can at the united state open in june but it mcilroy who is up first at augusta national golf club in georgiai know exactly the people i would be putting myself alongside he said it would be huge but again i cant think about it that wayhe ha lately been on a roll even for someone who seems to have plenty of time mcilroy is the momentum he brings into this year first major doesnt come around oftenlast month onestroke victory at the player championship capped a run of six start to open in which he finished no lower than sixth he also reached the round of at the wgc match play in march eliminated on the th hole of a tense battle with woodsright now it all rory mcilroy said paul azinger nbcs lead golf analyst he in contention every week weve criticized him whenever he didnt win then he go ahead and win the biggest event on the pga touryou just get the feeling that it going to be a big rory yearthough mcilroy is no in the world ranking behind dustin johnson and justin rose no one ha accumulated more ranking point since the calendar turnedwhen his mind right and he putting good said jason day who will also play at the master i think he explosivemcilroy ha shown an ability to pile up win in bunch he collected of them worldwide from through including three of his four major championship he wa second on other occasion during that spanthat said mcilroys current success ha been marked by a different demeanor and he is calm a he considers the big picture tournament result can vary but performance is the yardstickyoure not going to get frustrated playing good golf he saideven with a green jacket and a permanent entry in golf history at staketheres a difference between a personal desire and a need mcilroy said i would have said a couple of year ago i need to win a master i need a green jacket now it i want to win it id love to win it but if i dont im ok and i think that is the differencesuccess by mcilroy spieth or mickelson would elevate them to a stratosphere occupied only by gene sarazen ben hogan gary player nicklaus and woodswhen i first came out i just wanted to win any major mickelson said at last year u open any major would have been great now that ive won the other three major it u open specific i would love to win this one to win all four thats certainly a goal and nothing im shying away frommcilroy said it would be great if all three golfer achieved the grand slamhow good would it be this year if jordan won the pga and phil won the u open and i won augusta mcilroy said golf would be right in the center of all sport story if that were to happennot only is mcilroy leading off the quest he also widely considered by analyst to have the best chance of breaking throughif i wa a betting man i would bet that he get it said jim mackay now an nbc analyst after two decade a mickelsons caddiea couple of year ago such expectation might have affected mcilroy this is his fifth trip to augusta in which the master ha beckoned a the lone missing piece from his major collectioneach of his previous four master had left mcilroy exactly six stroke behind the winner his final position ha ranged from fourth to a share of th but the sixshot gap ha been unyieldinghis closest call came last year only to wind up the most disappointing trailing patrick reed by three and playing alongside him in the final pairing mcilroy cut into the deficit on the first hole and faced a short eagle putt at no that could have drawn him evenmcilroy missed tumbled to a closing and wound up with a share of fifththats when you really have to preach patience mcilroy said you know the golf is in there it just letting that golf come out when it matter most i need to almost take my foot off the gas and just let it happen and thats obviously easier said than donethen again he need only to look at the past few month to see how the process can pay dividendsthough he wa unable to clinch first against xander schauffeles charge at kapalua in january against johnson in mexico in february or in his own lack of birdie chance in march on the final day at bay hill in florida mcilroy latched onto positivesthen when victory finally arrived at the player his reaction a weak fist pump wa subduedits been having a focus over the last six of seven month on my attitude especially my attitude to golf said mcilroy who married shortly after the master not letting golf define who i am a a person trying to keep the two thing very separateits a mindset some player dont attain until long after theyre for now it seems to have freed mcilroy to play the most consistent golf of his career it may yield a green jacket but if it doesnt he prepared to deal with itat the end of the day all youre trying to do is get that ball in the hole he said if you feel like youre doing that pretty well then whats there to be frustrated aboutadvertisement

muscle stretch he swivel to his left and his eye lock on his left shoulder a he hold his club high a if to light a kerosene street lamp he pause at the top long enough to exhale loudly making a shoo sound before settling over his balljordan spieth the threetime major winner and the champion at pebble beach had seen video of choi and wa among those eager to see him up closei actually wa fascinated clearly by his swing and the way he move around spieth said adding it just really entertaining i think people are really excited to see him this weekchoi did not take up the game until he wa around the same age a the yearold spieth but he ha developed a showman touch the bigger the crowd the more he appears to play to it upon being introduced to warm applause on the first tee choi bowed to the

surprised choi by greeting him in korean kelly introduced himself to choi on the practice green with an outstretched hand and a wide grin we will have so much fun he told himafter the round choi broke into a broad smile of his own and said that kelly had been righti think my pairing wa just a good a the weather choi said through an interpreter referring to the abundant sunshine and negligible breeze and i learned a lot from jerry kellychoi know that he ha a lot of catching up to do he wa training for a job in the fishing industry he said until he lost the tip of his right thumb in a chain

rodgers one of his idol and choi whose swing he had watched on youtubelee joked that he had told his grandson to close his eye when choi took the club away because his swing wa not exactly something that impressionable youngster should be trying it fun to pull for a guy who so unique lee saidoutside the rope others seemed to share lee sentiment they cheered for every good shot and great escape orchestrated by choi who wa four over after hole but made three birdie in the final eight to salvage a oneover at the end of the second round on friday he wa tied for th place at four overi definitely

advertisementsupported bygolf is all about how you react when you get a bad bounceby thomas l friedmanopinion columnistalthough my day job is writing the foreign affair column for the new york time more persian gulf than fairway golf thinking about golf and playing a often a i can is my allconsuming hobby so like million of others i wa awed by tiger woods comeback for the age by his winning the master at year old what can be learned from itits hard for nongolfers to appreciate the scope of tiger physical and psychological achievement after he went through four back surgery and the global tabloid exposure of his industrialscale marital cheatingif i think of the news i normally cover it would be a if bill clinton came back and defeated donald trump for president in or in technology it the equivalent of steve job founding apple losing apple and then coming back and winning all four technology major the apple desktop laptop iphone and ipad with a reborn applethe biggest takeaway for me is the reminder of the truism that golf is the sport most like life because it is played on an uneven surface and everything is on you so good and bad bounce and selfinflicted mistake are built into the game and so much of success in golf a in life is about how you react to those good and bad bounce do you quit do you throw your club do you cheat do you whine do you blame your caddieor do you say what the greatest golfer say when a bounce turn against them or their ball end in a divot in the middle of the fairway and only a great shot will get them back into the hole they all say to their caddie the same two word watch this and then they pull off a remarkable shot that wind through the tree over the hill and past the sand trap avoids the pond on the left and land right in the middle of the putting green which is exactly the shot tiger hit on the th hole out of the tree at augusta national on sundayto do that under pressure is stunning but it is not just luck or even pure physical attribute it is about practice hour and hour and hour gary player liked to say the more i practice the luckier i get and that is where for me the meaning of tiger comeback begin his willingness to commit to endless hour of physical rehabilitation and then endless hour of practice how many of u have that iron will but the physical part is the least of itlast year i wrote the foreword to a golf instruction book by my teacher in which i argued that what make golf so difficult but also so satisfying when you get it right is that you have to combine four thing physic geometry geography and psychology tiger genius on sunday and so often throughout his career is his ability to master all four better than anyone elsehow so well every golf swing always start with a geography quiz how far away is that target and how is it set in the landscape is it elevated is it on a ledge is it in a bowl is it by an ocean cliff a stream or a pondthen come the geometry lesson at what angle and speed do i have to launch this little white ball to match or take advantage of this geography and get a close a possible to the hole taking into account the wind and temperature and landscape a wellthen come the physic lesson how do i move my arm and leg and shift my weight and at what speed torque size of backswing ball position and swing finish to ensure that my little white ball solves this geographygeometry riddle and land a close a possible to my targetand finally what emotional and psychological mindset do i need to increase the odds that my body and arm will move into the ideal launch position to achieve the geographygeometry solution that ive designed in my head a any golfer will tell you there is no greater buzz in the world than solving that puzzle with your body and watching your golf ball soar toward it intended target with the perfect geometry against the backdrop of some stunning geographytiger did that several time sunday and you could feel the buzz and none more intensely than on augusta national perilous th hole where he launched his ball on the perfect arc over the water softly curbing right to left with the terrain and then landing in the precise twofootdiameter circle so that it would then roll foot down the slope and stop inch below the hole geography geometry physic and psychology all working in perfect unisonyou can not overestimate the psychological aspect of that shot golf is such a head game and if you are distracted by something youll never put the geography geometry and physic together at the level needed to win in professional golf thats why tiger game deteriorated so far after his infidelity had been broadcast all over the world in and even before his back gave out you could actually see it when tiger walked through a golf gallery back then his eye never wanted to meet those of his fan because he knew that they knew that he knew that they knew that hed been a firstclass jerkwhat wa in his head translated into his hand and it translated into his score for the better part of a decade he could not win a major until his back wa healed and he got the monkey of his own misdeed off his back by becoming a good father and a better person to his fan and his fellow golfer you could see him looking everyone in the eye in the last couple of year and it finally unlocked his fan base it gave them permission to root for him again fullthroated despite all the way hed disappointed them and that clearly unlocked his mind and i am sure his body too so he could swing freely againand that lead to another way that golf is so much like life each and every round is a journey and like all of life journey it never a straight line it always full of crazy bounce selfinflicted mistake and unexpected detour and therefore always a journey of discovery about yourself and your playing partner and if you love the game it an everlasting journey in search of selfimprovement always trying to get your geography geometry physic and psychology in perfect alignmentand when you see it done at the highest level on the toughest terrain under the most intense spotlight by someone who had it lost it and then got it back you can only say what a privilege i saw tiger make his comeback and win the master at age what a crazy wonderful amazing journeythe time is committed to publishing a diversity of

security official at augusta national golf club might derail woods most memorable master surge in yearsafter wood hit a shot out of the tree left of the th hole a sprinting uniformed guard who wa trying to control the crowd just behind wood slipped on wet grass and slammed into woods right ankle wood recoiled and limped forward hopping on his left foot several time before regaining his footingbut wood who grimaced but never looked back kept striding toward the green in fact the episode seemed to spur him to greater heightswith the gallery around him cheering wildly wood birdied the

challenging first round on friday at the riviera country club where he heard the usual genial chant of kooooch from some of his fan but also a number of barb from others about his perceived parsimonykuchar ha earned more than million a a professional golfer but his problem began when he won a tournament in playa del carmen mexico that he had basically entered on a whimin a typical pga tour arrangement a caddie receives a flat rate of for a tournament which help cover expense and a bonus worth percent of the golfer winning for ortiz a local caddie who is also known a el tucan that would have amounted to about instead ortiz told michael bamberger of golfcom he and kuchar had agreed on a payment plus an unspecified amount of whatever money kuchar won at the tournamentkuchar meanwhile said he had promised ortiz if he missed the cut if he made the cut for a top finish and for a top finish with no specification for how much more he would pay ortiz if he finished firstwhich kuchar proceeded to do ending a fouryear winless drought at that point kuchar gave ortiz the he said they had agreed upon for the top finish and a bonus kuchar confirmed that total to golfcom and added for a guy who make a day a week is a really big weekbut the tone and content of that comment were quickly pounced on particularly by people from outside the insular world of golf and some golf fan werent too pleased by kuchars attitude either a kuchar walked down the first fairway on friday morning one fan stopped walking and shouted in kuchars direction frugal just frugal the fan yelled i

kuchar who is considered one of the more affable player on the tour said he viewed his initial comment in defense of the payment a out of touch and insensitivethey made it seem like i wa marginalizing

he then quizzed ortiz about the detail of his unwritten agreement with kuchar at which point graubart said he explained the typical pay scale to ortiz who seemed unaware that he could have earned more
