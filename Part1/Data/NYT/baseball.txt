advertisementsupported byby tyler kepnerport charlotte fla in a tangible sign of cooperation between the commissioner office and a skeptical player association major league baseball and the union announced several rule change on thursday that will affect the trading deadline the allstar game roster size and onfield strategythe rule some of which will not be implemented until demonstrate that after another winter in which many veteran free agent lingered for month on a sluggish open market the league and the player were willing to modify their current collective bargaining agreement even though it doe not expire until after the seasonits just good to see both side are working together said infielder matt duffy the union representative for the tampa bay ray it good when you have cooperation on both side of an industry i think that creates a healthy atmosphere for the industry and the game to thrivefor the player the change are largely a prelude to a more complicated renegotiation of the financial aspect of the cba which the side have agreed to discus but they will result in immediate difference to the sport this season including a single trading deadline on july read more a baseball debate it rule player suggest trying harder to winthat rule eliminates the archaic and somewhat confusing process of trade waiver which for year had created a second summer trading period player can still be placed and claimed on outright waiver after july according to the new rule but can not be traded after that datethe league also overhauled the selection process for the allstar game starter and added a million pool of bonus money for the home run derby including million for the winner that might not be enough to motivate highly paid star to take part but for many young player million would dwarf their annual salaryi just got engaged to be married said pete alonso a slugging mets prospect who would earn the minimum if he make the team so that would definitely pay for the wedding coststhe allstar starter nonpitchers will be selected in two phase a primary round and a designated election day in the first round fan will vote for the starter at each position a they have for many year then on a day in late june or early july fan will vote again choosing from the top three votegetters at each position in the initial round or the top nine for outfieldersplayers will receive bonus for finishing among the top votegetters at their position and the bonus pool for player on the winning team will increase if the allstar game go to extra inning each inning beyond the ninth will begin with a runner on second base with player allowed to reenter the game a pinchrunnersother change for this season further commissioner rob manfreds goal of speeding up the pace of play the average nineinning game took three hour last season down by five minute from but still minute longer than the average game in paceofplay rule for will not include a pitch clock but will include a reduction in mound visit from six to five and in the time between inning while the change remains to be reviewed with the holder of broadcast right those break would be reduced to two minute for all regularseason game from minute second for local telecast and for national telecaststhe more significant change will begin in roster will increase by one slot to player through the end of august in september though the maximum roster size will be reduced to from september game are a little outrageous at time especially when you get two team that are really competing for a postseason spot duffy said they want to give themselves the best chance to win a game and if that mean bringing in five or six reliever in one inning theyve got them down there why not use them i think youre going to see a little more realistic game in septemberhe added and the reality is to have percent of your season be decided in a certain way and then all of a sudden in the most important game everything flip completely thats a little weird tooteams will have a limit still to be determined on the number of pitcher allowed on the active roster and all pitcher will have to pitch to a minimum of three batter or to the end of a halfinning yankee reliever zack britton said player were conflicted on that rule which mlb will impose on it own with the union agreeing to not challenge itit change strategy for sure britton said i think nowadays there not a many specialized pitcher that are just righty or just lefty but obviously if there are guy out there it limit their role and job opportunitythen again britton said the addition of a th roster spot effectively creates another job for the unionadding one guy to the roster the whole year add a bunch of player that are going to get to arbitration sooner or hit free agency sooner britton said it allows you to give some of your player some day off especially adding a position player or bench guymany people in baseball had assumed the th man would be part of the last collective bargaining agreement which went into effect before the season for the kansa city royal a team that relies more on speed than other team the extra spot would make it easier to put a pinchrunner on the rosterfor example were going to carry terrance gore to start the season for sure general manager dayton moore said last week referring to a player with one career hit but stolen base including the postseason although terrance ha made a lot of stride a somebody who could potentially be utilized a an extra outfielder youd feel a lot better about that if there wa a th manthe change for also include restriction on position player pitching limiting those appearance to extra inning or game in which the pitcher team trail or lead by at least six run the injured list for pitcher will also be returned to day from a it ha been for all player since kevin armstrong contributed reporting from port st lucie fla and james wagner from tampa

sport is a the perfect reflection of his sportlittle known to many american including some sport fan trout is the best player in a game that ha frequently been mocked a a fading form of entertainment with primarily regional audiencesbaseball is often dismissed a far le enticing than the nfl which is believed to bring in more than billion annually even with it health and safety issue baseball also is called le dynamic than the nba even though it had about billion le in revenue than mlb last yearso when trout year million contract wa revealed it prompted an obvious question how could a sport that is struggling to attract a new generation of fan and that is facing a potentially bruising labor fight with it player in two year afford yet another ninefigure contractnews of trout deal came about three week after outfielder bryce harper accepted a year million contract with the phillies and a month after infielder manny machado got a year million deal from the san diego padresa comparison of all the major league baseball player who signed contract of at least millionthe answer ha more to do with the mechanic of the collective bargaining agreement between player and owner than with anything that might constitute a referendum on the game popularity there are several dynamic at work in the sport where huge wealth still flow to the best of the best while there is le money left over for the socalled middle class despite continuing growth in baseball revenuesowners it seems have figured out how to keep cost down by using younger player who are cheaper than veteran thus freeing up cash for the occasional megadeal player like trout harper and machado benefit while others are forced to accept lessin the past team were valuing player differently said james paxton a starting pitcher for the yankee for a long time that system wa fine now that the team have changed the way theyre valuing player especially older player it kind of broken the system and it is forcing u to take a look at itin a study that ha not yet been published jc bradbury an economics professor at kennesaw state university calculated that baseball revenue rose at an average rate of percent from to while player salary rose at an average rate of just percentmajor league baseball revenue reached billion last year the source include evermore money from guaranteed source like multibilliondollar medium deal for the entire sport and other lucrative medium contract many at the local level le important have been ticket sale which generally fluctuate with win and losseswith the shift in valuation of player the average salary went down in for the first time in year to a little more than million according to the player association it wa just the fourth time in the last year that the average ha gone downdan halem the deputy commissioner of mlb said there wa no evidence of team not trying to win and he painted a very different picture of baseball economicssalaries have gone up on average percent each year since keeping pace with baseball revenue growth during that time he said and while the pay may have been slightly down or flat in one year doe not make a trend he also said that over the last decade the player had received a consistent percentage of the game revenue from to percentin a marketbased system depending upon the year and how our club are valuing player said halem certain player do better than othersyet word like collusion and strike once the third rail of the sport especially after the ruinous strike of are now regularly uttered by player and agent despite the huge contractsfocusing on giant deal miss the bigger picture according to jeff borris a longtime baseball agent who ha represented star like barry bond and is now the general counsel of the ballengee group a sport representation agencycontracts like trout and harper are aberration borris said the focus should be more on thing like why isnt dallas keuchel signed or the contract that gio gonzalez just signed those are the area that are of concernkeuchel a twotime allstar starting pitcher for the houston astros remained unsigned one week before opening day while gonzalez a solid durable starting pitcher ha signed a minorleague deal with the yankeesi think the owner are manipulating the system to their advantage borris saidfor decade baseball player have been represented by what is widely considered to be the strongest union in all of professional sport a a result baseball ha no limit on salary though it luxury tax which penalizes a team after it payroll rise above million can function a a de facto capthe problem now at least a articulated by player is that while team reward superstar they no longer feel compelled to spend to win if they do not believe they already have the piece in place to compete for a championshipwhy is there not an interest in player that can help team win particularly a we get to the last two week of spring training tony clark the executive director of the player association said before the trout deal wa reacheddespite baseball strong union certain provision that kept salary rising for decade turned out to be norm not hard and fast rulesbaseball player do not become free agent until they accrue six year of service time they are generally paid at the league minimum for their first three season while in the next three they can receive higher salary through negotiation or arbitration this lead to odd situation like trout being voted the american league most valuable player in his third full season while earning just millionthis used to be acceptable to player because they made up for it on the back end of their career there are the infamous albatross contract given to veteran like the million extension signed by ryan howard in but most of the time it wa veteran player being paid a fair wage or being slightly overpaid well into their s and sometimes sits not a coincidence that trout harper and machado all got their megadeals at the age of or younger but a the circumstance of older player like gonzalez and keuchel demonstrate team have been working on the assumption that a veteran ability are likely to decline soon after his salary peak and that it make sense to use younger player who can fill out a roster at lower cost and risk even if the chance to make the playoff is also reducedi dont think that we thought that team all of a sudden were going to just stop competing to the degree that they are now said adam ottavino a yankee pitcher a lot of thing changed really fastemail kevin draper at

teamtryouts were on a cold saturday morning and a i walked over to the playground i wondered what i wa getting myself into i had known about this league for year but joining had never occurred to me something though made me more open i missed sport the current that run through you when you catch the meaty part of the ball with your bat the way everyone cheer when the shortstop catch a line drive to win the game i wanted to be in the park at dusk that perfect time of day in summer when the sun finally stop being punishing and all of the field look orange in the light and i wanted the camaraderie of a teamstill dream of friendship and sunset over baseball diamond were one thing throwing a softball for the first time with three dozen stranger in fingerstiffening temperature wa entirely anothera middleaged woman with dimple pinned the number to the back of my sweatshirt and sent me off to play catch the ball wa big but it flew easily out of my hand and into my partner glove it felt good to throw familiar even we took turn hitting then fielded grounder at every base each time i scooped up the ball and hurled it at first each time my throw went straight into the woman mittthe first month wa good our team played once a week after most game wed head to a bar where wed drink a few beer and rehash the ump bad call softball wa turning out exactly a i had hoped it wouldand then sometime in june i started throwing wildim not sure how it happened all i know is that i suddenly found myself incapable of throwing the ball the loss of skill wa so complete that it wa a if i had never been able to throw a ball in my life except that i remembered so clearly that it wa agonizing a time when throwing wa the most natural action in my body repertoire the motion wa so deeply etched in my ligament that it seemed like the process happened entirely outside my brainthe disappearance of something i had always been good at the fear that it would never come back the feeling that something valuable had been taken from me without explanation it wa like losing baseball all over againit turn out that the sudden inability to complete the most basic motion in sport ha a name the yipsas i soon discovered on wikipedia the yip is the loss of fine motor skill in athlete it occurs without apparent explanation and wikipedia helpfully informed me it ha no known treatmentgreati read about highprofile case chuck knoblauch the second baseman who once hit a sportscaster mother in the face with a wild ball mackey sasser the catcher who couldnt throw back to the pitcher without doubletakingand then there wa steve blass the great pitcher who developed the yip and wa sent down to the minor i dug up roger angells profile of him from the new yorker and read every word hoping to uncover some secret that would change my own luck there wa of course nothing mr blass retired early and became a jewelry salesmanat first my team chalked it up to nervesnaomi my coach shouted after i fielded a grounder and then threw it foot to her right at practice just relaxi tried but the problem with trying to relax is that the more you try the le relaxed you feel i tried to take my time i tried to be natural i tried to focus on the mechanic i tried not to focus on the mechanic at all i tried to think about being loose i tried to think about throwing hard i tried really really hard not to thinksometimes it would work for a while id land a few good toss and hopefulness would creep in but inevitably the anxiety would catch up to me and soon enough a ball would sail past my partner sending her jogging into the distance to retrieve itafter a particularly rough game my coach pulled me aside i had been desperate to tell someone on the team what wa happening to me that i wa under some kind of curse that my baseball skill had apparently gone into a coma that this wasnt the real me i thought this wa my chanceyou know ive been having this weird problem maybe it anxiety this thing happens where i cant throw the ballher face went blank dont worry bud we all get nervous she said just do your best she patted me on the shoulder and headed offthe realization came with a thud to my coach i wasnt suffering from some kind of performance anxiety i just suckedso again i quit i didnt want to further damage my relationship to something that had once been a source of joy i stopped playing baseball when i wa but i had always carried it with me a something that i wa good at something that no one could take away now it seemed that the opposite wa true one weekend after i left the team my partner and i made plan to go away with her family her father had been a semipro pitcher in his youthyou should bring your glove she said i bet my dad would love to play with youa few day later she spoke to her father on the phone i told him about your problem she said he said the same thing happened to him once and he said what you need to do is i readied myself for advice i couldnt use set your foot before you throw just relax but that wasnt what wa cominghe said you need to find a wall with no one around and take a ball there and throw it against the wall for a long time over and over until it come back to you all alonei thought about the hour i spent a a kid throwing a ball against a wall old tennis ball against my parent stoop blue sky bounce ball against my elementary school building at recess when we went to my aunt and uncle house in the suburb we threw baseball against the garage door until they left mark and we got in trouble it wa the kind of throwing i longed for now the kind of throwing you dont have to think abouti didnt bring my glove on vacation but i did stop into a sporting good store a few week ago i asked the salesman if there were any softball soft enough to throw against a wall and he pointed me to a box of neonyellow onesi flung one against the floor it leapt up at me satisfying easily making it way back into my handi bought it it been sitting on my dresser for a while nowtheres a playground down the street from my parent house we used to play catch there and basketball and sometimes wed skateboard i havent been in

until when rivera discovered his signature cutter while playing catch with ramiro mendoza before a game in detroit after that thing normalized between martinez and rivera for including the one encounter that still bother martinezin the american league championship series martinez came up a the tying run with two out in the top of the ninth inning of game im like ok he going to throw the cutter im going to look middleaway like i always said and then the first sinker ive seen off mariano my whole career he put a sinker in said martinez who grounded out meekly to short game over were going home i would have traded all those hit just for that atbatthe mariner have not come that close to the world series since they lost to the yankee again in the next alcs in five game mussina won his start in that series but martinez usually confounded himi could have a different order of pitch i could try fastball first breaking ball first get ahead in the count get behind in the count it didnt matter mussina saidwhen youre a good a hitter a he wa then you just say listen im going throw it in the middle and hope he hit it really hard right to somebody because if i try real hard and he still get a hit is this going to make me mad and honestly sometimes you do that you say im going to throw a sinker right down the middle man j ust hit it in the first two pitch and let move on because youre going to get a hit anyway mussina dominated many slugger by reading their swing and serving up a pitch they could not handle david ortiz rafael palmeiro alex rodriguez and jim thome who combined for more than home run batted a combined off himbut martinez wa hard for mussina to read because he never tried to do too much martinez said he learned his approach by watching hitter like george brett jose cruz and kirby puckett who played a combined season without ever striking out time martinez did so only once in his final seasonmost of the hitter they look middlein to pull martinez said i wasnt that type of hitter i would look middleaway and inside id react and if i worked on my mechanic in my swing path and my lower half i wa able to leave the bat in the zone longer thats why even if it something soft the bat is still in the zone and i could drive the ball to all field or cover line to linenaturally some pitcher vexed martinez he struggled against nolan ryan for and pedro martinez for and wa hitless in his only game against greg maddux but those three will not surround his plaque in cooperstown to the newest hall of famers martinez is part of their class but belongs in a class of his ownguys tried to hit the ball off the fence too much and id get em on a ground ball to short or a fly ball to center and thats how i survived edgar didnt do that mussina said he just took a line drive to right field it worked for him and it drove in a ton of run and it frustrated me to death thats why he sitting up here he did that to everybodyadvertisement

advertisementsupported byon baseballby tyler kepnersurprise ariz after the kansa city royal departed for a spring training road game last month their general manager dayton moore stayed behind at the team training complex to watch prospect on the back field it wa from there more than a decade ago that a longtime coach bill fischer had called him excitedly to share a visionfish said i just saw the latin version of johnny bench moore said sitting in a dugout and smiling at the memory i said who that he said salvador perez fish recognized it right awaybench may have been the greatest catcher ever but perez is the only other catcher to make at least six allstar team while winning five gold glove and a world series most valuable player awardhe is a rare modern specie a highimpact offensive catcher who play a lot of gamesas recently a player appeared in at least game a a catcher last season that number had dwindled to the fewest since the major expanded to team in perez did it for the sixth season in a row but his streak will end in at the moment moore spoke perez wa in los angeles to undergo tommy john surgery which will cost him the seasonits a big blow to the morale of the organization because salvys our energygiver out there moore said the fan adore him and they show up to watch him play regardless of where we are in the standingswithout perez who hit homer in each of the last two season catcher offensive production could slip again this season in major league catcher produced a batting average and a onbase plus slugging percentage both the lowest figure of the team eraits a very physically demanding position but thats been true for year said matt klentak the general manager of the philadelphia phillies on top of that there ha been a shift throughout the league in recent year in the way catcher defense is evaluated prioritizing catcher framing the impact of framing on a game is real and in some case team are willing to trade out some offense in exchange for better receiving skillscatchers who can hit are still valued a evidenced by the phillies trade with the miami marlin for j t realmuto the game best offensive catcher but the boston red sox showed last season that a slugger behind the plate is not always necessary they won the world series despite a average and ops from their catcher the worst mark for any champion in the liveball erawe look at catcher a a defensive position said dave dombrowski boston president of baseball operation and so the defensive efficiency they bring to u not only the thing you can measure with framing throwing guy out and time to second base but handling the staff following the game plan that we want we put a high priority on thatand the job is only getting more challenging team use more pitcher per season than ever and while fastball velocity ha risen in recent year pitcher are also throwing a greater percentage of breaking ball that is one factor explaining why wild pitch and passed ball are on the risemore important though is the emphasis on framing that is getting borderline pitch called for strike when a catcher try to present a pitch on the corner a a strike he will try to keep most of his glove in the strike zone catching such pitch in the tip of the webbing and not the pocket naturally lead to more pitch that clip the edge of the mitt and roll awayit may be the most demanding position in all of sport moore said there are more good nfl quarterback than there are complete major league catcher with the standard we were raised withthose standard are changing a reflected by the red sox who were so satisfied with catcher blake swihart and christian vasquez that they brought them both back despite their weak bat boston catcher excelled on defense ranking third in the major at framing according to baseball prospectus the two team above them were the national league champion los angeles dodger and in first place the arizona diamondbacksit is no coincidence that one of arizona catcher last season jeff mathis attracted the attention of the team that ranked worst at framing the texas ranger mathis hit and ha a average across season but his exceptional defensive skill earned him a twoyear million deal from the rangersthat is a modest deal by industry standard but it is the richest one mathis who turn this month ha ever signed he might have had little market appeal anymore if not for today method of measuring defenseive always taken a lot of pride in the defensive side of my game mathis said obviously id love to contribute a lot more offensively and i think i can but for them to acknowledge defense the way they have the last few year is something that ive definitely benefited from and definitely thankful forjon daniel the ranger president of baseball operation said the team determined at the start of the offseason to target a defensiveoriented catcher the ranger are entering their final season at outdoor globe life park a hitter paradise and plan to integrate young pitcher onto their roster a they move to an indoor ballpark in besides mathis the ranger considered martin maldonado who lingered on the market and eventually signed with the royal a perezs replacement for million maldonado had a meager ops for the los angeles angel last season but still appealed to the houston astros who traded for him in july and started him in six of their eight playoff gamesthe previous october brian mccann caught every inning for the astros through their victory in game of the world series the yearold mccann who is second on the active list in game caught behind the st louis cardinal yadier molina slumped to a average last season and signed for one year and million with his original team the atlanta bravesjeff luhnow the astros general manager and a former cardinal executive spoke wistfully recently about the day of having a yadi molina he could not bring himself to say that those day are over but he doe not see a successorim sure there will be some guy like that in the future but i dont know why were not developing catcher a much luhnow said of all the position in baseball thats probably the thinnestthis may simply be a down cycle baseball america ranked seven catcher among it top prospect this season the most since then again that crop from seven year ago travis darnaud yasmani grandal devin mesoraco jesus montero wilin rosario gary sanchez and swihart ha not yielded many starsneal huntington the pittsburgh pirate general manager said the rise of yearround amateur baseball could be burning out catching prospect the relentless physical demand he said do not help developing hitter if a catching prospect show a promising bat he added talent evaluator may want him to change position bryce harper the phillies new million outfielder wa a catcher a an amateurthe guy who may be a midrange defender but can swing the bat a little bit we may be thinking about shifting him out from behind home plate because we want the bat to play and weve become so strict on receiving analytics that were almost unforgiving in some case huntington saidso weve shifted the pendulum way to the defensive side because we recognize the value it brings there also value in that guy who can receive and hit but that guy who an exceptional receiver he get the benefit of the doubt every single time and weve been able to quantify that so the guy that used to kind of fade away are now hanging around longermathis wa not the only veteran catcher to receive a multiyear deal in free agency kurt suzuki got a twoyear million contract in november from the washington national who did not stop there ten day later they traded for yan gomes an allstar catcher for cleveland last seasonsuzuki who caught game for oakland in his first full season in the major said he wa happy to share the role the same analytics wave that identifies and value catcher defense also make the job more demanding because of the volume of information to process before gamesit used to be a dvd suzuki said youd watch video and go this is how were going to get him out now youve got all these heat map velocity and youre like wow this is a brain cram it a lot of studying a lot of stress and strain on the brain to have that mental rest is awesomethe national timesharing plan is becoming more of the rule than the exception the productive hitter who catch nearly every game is harder and harder to find even at least for this season in kansa cityadvertisement

acrosswide part of seamsthumbs bentand under ballphotographs by stephen dunngetty image rivera jeff lewisassociated pressby tyler kepnermariano rivera will not be the only player elected to the baseball hall of fame this week on his first try public ballot have shown overwhelming support for roy halladay the former ace of the toronto blue jay and the philadelphia phillies if halladay were here he would surely acknowledge that rivera the sublime yankee closer helped nudge him over the cooperstown borderhalladay died on nov at age when the small plane he wa piloting crashed into shallow water near holiday fla in one of his final interview he enthusiastically recalled a tutorial with rivera at the allstar game and a tip that gave him his final burst of brillianceid been watching mariano a lot and my cutter wa pretty good but it wasnt always consistent halladay said in march at a picnic table beneath palm tree at the phillies training complex in clearwater fla there were time where it would be really good and other time when it just wasnt a effective mariano really helped mei had chased halladay for more than two year to set up this conversation i needed his perspective for a book i wa writing on pitching k a history of baseball in ten pitch to be published this spring by doubleday and knew he would be a critical voiceas the new york times yankee beat writer for most of his blue jay tenure i had marveled at halladay the way he stoically baited elite hitter into tentative swing and never seemed satisfied unless he had worked nine inning he had just returned to the phillies in a an instructor advising minor leaguers on the mental side of the sport halladay had rebuilt his confidence and delivery early in his career and he never stopped reinventing himself on the moundwith his cutter halladay suspected that the problem wa his thumb position rivera wa a legend by then on his way to a record career save and his name became synonymous with the cutter a pitch he had found by accident but had mastered like no other he confirmed halladays guesssure enough halladay said he told me that one of the key for him wa making sure he wrapped his thumb under and got it on the opposite side of the ballwhen halladay threw his sinker with his index and middle finger along the narrow seam he placed his thumb directly under his index finger on the bottom of the ball when he threw his cutter which he held with his index and middle finger across the wide part of the seam he always put his thumb in the same spotrivera showed halladay his technique bending his thumb at the knuckle and tucking it under the ball so the nail wa even with the middle finger not the index finger this kept the thumb pad from blocking the ball spin a it left his hand allowing the index and middle finger to pull through unimpeded and send it on it path veering inside to a lefty hitter and away from a rightyi handed halladay a ball and he wrapped it in rivera grip holding his arm out straightso now if you look at it from behind you have all the ball sticking out on this side he said and from the pitcher perspective you could see at least half the ball peeking out from the left side of the hand the rest of the ball wa covered by halladays fingersso now it overloaded it almost ha to go that way he said when i got my thumb underneath the index finger it wa still centered but a soon a i get it moved over then all of a sudden it overload the ball on that sidedid it feel natural right awayit took a little while halladay said and it wa so awkward at time that when it wa really good i traced my finger on the ball with a pen i just took a black ballpoint pen and traced it right where my finger placement wa and i put it in my locker and just stored it and kept it with me well the next spring i wa throwing it and it wasnt working i wasnt getting result out of it so i went back and picked up that ball and just grabbed it without looking at the mark and sure enough my thumb wa back to here where it felt comfortableso i put it back on that mark where it wa a little uncomfortable at first but sure enough it came right back then you get used to it and youre like ok but it wa a pitch that you really had to monitor where you were how you grip it because you could get in bad habit just from long tossing it just an odd place to throw a ballhalladay beat the yankee three time in the second half of the season when rivera teammate learned of his generosity to a rival they fined him in kangaroo court for halladay it wa a springboardin the three year that followed one with toronto two with philadelphia halladay wa the best pitcher in baseball he threw the most inning averaged victory a season and his earned run average wa the lowest among pitcher with at least start he won his second cy young award threw a perfect game and then threw just the second postseason nohitter in major league historythose three year gave halladay a full decade at the top of his game fewer dominant season than some hall of famers but enough to sway the voter had he instead declined sharply after he would have been the same kind of candidate a johan santanasantana collected just percent of the vote in last year election not enough to stay on the ballot but for seven season for the minnesota twin and the mets through santana wa every bit a dominant a halladay wa in his first seven season of success through in santanas sevenyear run he had win and a era with a whip walk plus hit per inning pitched of in his first seven year of stardom halladay had win and a era with a whip santana had more strikeout halladay fewer walk but their result were essentially the samefor santana though that wa just about all he had besides a threemonth renaissance in including the mets longawaited first nohitter santana wa finished at his peak he pitched like a hall of famer but his prime wa just too shorthalladays prime lasted just long enough it wa not all thanks to rivera cut fastball of course but in those first three season after rivera help halladay threw the cutter for percent of his pitch more often than any other starter in baseball his other favorite pitch the sinker moved in the opposite direction at time it seemed unfairtoughest on me halladay that sinker and cutter derek jeter told me last spring i tried to just guess which way it going to go and i always guessed wrongjeter hit in his career against halladay whose control wa so impeccable that his walk rate in those three year per nine inning wa the best in the game and if he ever lost the feel for the cutter he knew where to find it on the ball with rivera grip traced onto itid keep it in my locker and when wed go on the road i put it in my travel bag halladay said stuck it in a shoe wherever i went and if i wa struggling id just pick it up i carried it the rest of my careerperhaps that ball remains among halladays career possession what a poignant artifact it would be for the display case honoring the new inductee in cooperstownfollow tyler kepner on twitter tylerkepneradvertisement

round it wa one of the most emphatic championship run in recent history but only in the retellingpeople generalize and theyll say ok the red sox won game and went in the postseason look how easy it wa said dave dombrowski the president of baseball operation from his office at jetblue park this week well it wasnt easy it really wasnt during the regular season even with win the yankee won and i know people say oh thats an eightgame difference which i understand can be quite a bit but it sure didnt feel that waythe season essentially hinged on boston fourgame sweep of the yankee at fenway park in early august had the yankee won those game instead both team would have finished with victory that is how close the old rival werethey diverged this winter though with revealing approach to the offseason the red sox are prepared to rely heavily on their starting rotation while the yankee reinvested significantly in their bullpenthe yankee gave threeyear deal to two freeagent reliever zack britton million and adam ottavino million the red sox who will face the yankee for the second and final time this spring at steinbrenner field on friday spent about the same amount to retain starter nathan eovaldi for four year and million but they lost two reliever joe kelly who signed for three year and million with the los angeles dodger and closer craig kimbrel who is unsigned without replacing themthey wanted me back i wanted to be back here and we were able to make that work eovaldi said wednesday after his first start of the exhibition season we kept on that same game plan with that goal in mind to be able to come back and win a world series were taking the little step now to be able to do thatthe red sox will again have baseball highest payroll at more than million but they still had to make choice especially with several important player facing free agency within the next two yearsthey chose to keep their sturdy rotation together at a cost of about million for chris sale david price rick porcello and eovaldi those four and eduardo rodriguez who earns million went for boston last season including octoberin my opinion it just good baseball said porcello the al cy young award winner most of the team that are competing for a world series yearin and yearout have good starting rotation and almost all of the team that have won have had acetype guy and guy that fill out the rotation to give them the foundation they needfor u a starting pitcher we want to chew up the most inning a possible and give the team a chance to win a frequently a we canthe boston starter actually did not throw very many inning last season porcello led the staff with ⅓ with price at sale at rodriguez at ⅔ and eovaldi at including his time with tampa bay but the yankee got even fewer inning from their starter and their newcomer james paxton never threw more than ⅓ inning in his six season with seattleseveral team have shifted to a model that emphasizes quality over bulk from their starter outing fewer inning but more effective one a plan that relies on a procession of reliable reliever the yankee should have that luxury this season with britton and ottavino to go with chad green dellin betances and closer aroldis chapmanthe red sox bullpen is far le imposing matt barnes ryan brazier heath hembree brian johnson tyler thornburg hector velazquez and another spot to be determined dombrowski said he wa confident in the group and in the team ability to identify other option if it failsyou can find reliever and reliever have a tendency to come from anywhere he said history show you that right now short of the premium guy there a lot of inconsistency in reliever from year to year part of it is they get used so much when theyre pitching well that one season for me i just choose to go with the starting pitcher assuming theyre of quality naturethe red soxs trick last fall wa in letting their elite starter double a dominant reliever manager alex cora brought along the starter slowly last spring training a he is doing again now and the sweep of the yankee in august allowed him to carefully manage their workload down the stretchthe result wa a mostly fresh rotation a sale price porcello eovaldi and rodriguez all appeared a both starter and reliever in the postseason eovaldi pitched in a setup role to help win game and of the world series in boston then threw pitch in relief at dodger stadium in game an inning red sox lossthat wa the rare moral victory that also had tangible benefit galvanizing the red sox clubhouse around eovaldi and crystallizing the starter selfless approach even if they still dont buy the hooplaever since i wa watching baseball a a kid im watching randy johnson run out of the bullpen and pitch the eighth inning or whatever porcello said a far a im concerned i actually dont understand the big deal around it because thats our job and if were not here to sell out when we have the opportunity to win a world series then what are we doingcora absorbed the startersasrelievers strategy in a the bench coach for houston championship team the astros and red sox showed that the bullpen listed on a regularseason lineup card is not always the same a the one a team will use to win a titledombrowski said it wa presumptuous with a long season ahead and the yankee always looming to plan on reprising that plan this october but cora is eager for an encore knowing perhaps that it represents this roster best chance to repeatit wa fun to get text message hey give me the ball tomorrow cora said it a testament to who they are how they felt and what they wanted i tell you we get to october this year i guarantee you it going to be the same thing the same mode im there for youadvertisement

outfielder stephen piscotty said in mesa ariz a few day before the a left spring training i cant wait i wa just so fired up when i heard we were goingthe a are there essentially because the seattle

threeyear playoff streak the a faced seattle to begin that season and opened with the boston red sox in tokyo in it get you even closer manager bob melvin said of the seasonopening trip we have some new guy here this year but we do have a core group thats been together came up through the minor league together ha won together all that play and there value in thatthe a talk a lot about intangible which might seem odd for the team most responsible for the analytics wave that ha washed across the game this century but they improved to win last season from in so hear them out the path to their improbable wildcard berth closer blake treinen said started with a selfless attitudewhen everybody doe that a beautiful thing happens and thats what happened with u last year he said i mean nobody even guessed win nobody guessed probably you can stack everything up into analytics if you want and there a place for it but there also a place for heartheart yes but oakland formula also includes home run stingy relief pitching and especially stellar defense from matt chapman and matt olson cornerstone on the corner olson won a gold glove at first base and chapman won it at third base while adding a platinum glove for best overall fielder in the american leaguei havent got it yet i think they present it during the year and then you get to take it home said chapman but i dont have a house so it going to go in my parent front room probably theyll probably put the gold glove and the platinum glove in their house and hopefully some more to comelast season wa chapman first full year in the major except for a onegame injury rehabilitation assignment a it wa for olson who wa the only al player to appear in all gamesolsons agility and long lever he is foot inch were a big help for chapman and shortstop marcus semien a reliable first baseman is perhaps more important for the a than for any other team because their ballpark ha the most foul territory in the major and a throw that skip past olson would typically result in two extra basesi cant tell you how many time he saved an ontherun play i made that i threw up the line or he dug out chapman said he like foot tall on the bag but then hell pick anything and go in the line he not afraid to sacrifice his body im thankful for him i probably owe him some steak dinner now that i think about itonly the yankee and the los angeles dodger hit more homer last season than the a who bring back their top four homerun hitter khris davis the majorleague leader with olson piscotty and chapman but they added only marco estrada to a thin starting rotation and melvin would prefer not to use an opener a he did in last fall wildcard loss to the yankeesthat make it essential for the a to prevent run with standout defense and chapman set the standardhes a freak athlete to start olson said he get to some thing i had never seen before i played with him he consistent he hardworking you can find him in batting practice every day running himself tired taking ground ball we always say he like a dog just out there having funchapman attended el toro high school in lake forest calif with nolan arenado of the colorado rockies the perennial nl gold glove third baseman who is two year older both player were shortstop then but chapman said he closely followed top third basemen like adrian beltre evan longoria and david wright to melvin chapman already belongs in their classthe arm strength the ground that he cover both on the ground and in the air and at our ballpark in the air is big because it down into the bullpen it over to the dugout melvin said with shift you put him at shortstop and you know he going to cover the whole left side of the infield and want to cover the whole left side of the infieldadded melvin who ha played and managed in the major for season i dont know that ive been around a talented a defender a he is probably eversuzukis return to the mariner active roster will command the most attention in the

throat cancer two year ago and seems eager for moreim just so encouraged said jones a he surveyed the padre locker room at the peoria sport complex the other morning it so much more fun the competition is real here and there are expectation which is what you needafter claiming one of the most prized free agent in manny machado this offseason the padre are facing something rare for their franchise high expectation they have lost more game than any other franchise since they started play in and have managed just winning season no championship and one lingering stereotypethat laidback atmosphere of san diego these player have got to get beyond that theyve got to stay focused said jones who won a cy young award and hold the team record for start and inning over the year ive watched this organization that might be a challenge a little bit it just san diego itself keeping that intensity it take a little more work in san diego than maybe some other citiesintensity should not be a problem anymore the padre rocked the industry last month with the huge contract for machado a slugger with two gold glove at third base the right side of their infield also arrived through free agency first baseman eric hosmer who signed last year and second baseman ian kinsler those two have played in five world series combined they do not take losing wellwe dont play baseball game to develop we play baseball game to win them said kinsler after hitting a homer stealing a base and scoring twice in an exhibition victory on thursday we all play the game a certain way and thats what we want to bringso the padre play with an edge now they also might have a strong lineup or at least a lineup that should not finish last in the national league in onbase percentage and first in strikeout a it did last yearthis is a very real offense we have here left fielder wil myers said two year ago we had three rule guy and now we have manny machado and eric hosmer it a completely different flip of whats happened here over the year and it excitingeven with all the offensive potential the padre still lack a modernday randy jones no current padre worked more than majorleague inning last season for all the money they invested in machado the padre added only one starter in free agency garrett richards who had tommy john surgery last summer and will probably not pitch this season signed for two

senior scouting adviser had raved about the padre pitching depth reassuring him the organization wa especially wellstockedtheyd never seen a much pitching in one spot in one system at one time preller said were going to bank on those guy developing we understand some guy may not reach their ceiling but from our standpoint when you have the number we feel like were going to have some guy are going to be better than we think theyll be and theyll step up and take those spot so were going to give those guy an opportunityas preller spoke on a patio above the practice field another young pitcher cal

america espn fangraphs and mlbcom all rank san diegos farm system a the best in the gamethis is a source of pride for preller but only a a mean to producing the kind of consistently competitive team san diego ha never hadit definitely wasnt the goal of anyone in the organization to say weve got one of the better farm system in the game he said i think what that enables you to do from a trade standpoint competition depth having answer if you have injury thats more important than looking up and saying youve got a farm system fan want to see it at the major league level now our job is to try to convert that to majorleague winsthe thriving system wa critical to affording the contract of machado hosmer and myers who will combine to earn million each season from through the padre expect highimpact lowcost hitter to surround them including shortstop fernando tati jr right fielder franmil reyes and catcher francisco mejiawhen we took over a few year ago i thought it wa going to take a few year to build it the right way said preller who joined the padre in august but i think were in position now to start being competitive a a club and not just have it a a oneyear blip year in and year out weve got more answer than questionsfor now though there are many more question than answer the padre are still a lastplace team trying to stop a string of eight consecutive losing season the longest stretch of futility since the brownandgold beginning of this woebegone franchisethe padre who will at last bring back their brown uniform next season have hope now they must justify itwe

year wa the lowest ever for a player with at least plate appearance said he learned to be more open with teammate to not let his frustration fester the oriole owner learned it wa time to finally

in baseball so simply bringing in better process is not going to ensure a division title if we do want to win one or a few this is a mandatory change in the current environmentthe oriole are far from hopeless they have not won a game beyond the divisional round since but they had the american league best record from through reaching the postseason three time the trick is sustaining a winner and for that model elia cite the cardinal a midmarket franchise with playoff appearance and only one losing record in the sthey have done such a great job of not overextending themselves or painting themselves into a corner elia said you have to make some difficult decision and make your decision well which is a challenge on u a a front office but it is possible to maintain a long competitive state by having a quality organization drafting well making shrewd decision and not making emotional irresponsible decision when it come to free agent or extensionsthis year oriole team might not post another winning percentage only one team in franchise history wa worse in when they were the st louis brown but expectation are low elia ha signed only one major league free agent pitcher nathan karns who missed last season with an elbow injury the top returning oriole by win above replacement last season is richard bleier who pitched all of ⅔ inningsthe oriole emphasis is clearly on the future establishing a much stronger presence in latin america drafting first over all this june adding staffer to a lean front office the major league roster is in fluxits an open competition in a lot of way in a lot of place on the mound on defense said brandon hyde the oriole rookie manager there a lot of spot that are open and open in a great wayhyde wa another fitting hire to replace manager buck showalter hyde spent the last seven season with the chicago cub another team with a deliberate rebuild that worked he wa a minor league field coordinator playerdevelopment director and major league coach for the cub who revived a dormant franchise with smart trade and draft choicesa lot of those young guy came a lot faster than we thought too hyde said the same thing with houstonthe cub the astros and the cardinal now come to camp every spring training expecting to compete for a championship that goal seems far off for the oriole but at least they have the right blueprinti think well look back maybe a year or two from now and see what we had this year and itll be kind of a special moment to see what weve become pitcher dylan bundy said youve got to start somewhere and it start this yearadvertisement
advertisementsupported byon baseballby tyler kepnerthe boston red sox received their latest world series ring on tuesday and this version their fourth in the last season is a beauty encircling the facing are two row of total diamond symbolizing the franchise nine overall championship and it victory in the inscription under the band is not subtle team for the agesso it wa the red sox were so dominant last october that they lost only once in each of their three postseason series in their first three series of this season though they won only once apiece they lost their home opener too leaving their record at before thursday night game against the toronto blue jaysthe easy explanation is the schedule the red sox were the last team to play at home this season opening on the road against the seattle mariner the oakland athletics and the arizona diamondback before finally staggering back to fenway park no other defending champion had ever played it first game on the roadthen again any rough part of a schedule always by definition creates an easier patch later the red sox have already finished their longest road trip of the season and they will play of their final game at fenway the yankee on the other hand will play just six of their final game in the bronxby then perhaps the tampa bay ray will have run away with the american league east the ray were boston mirror image through game with a record while tampa bay starter had a major leaguebest earned run average in those game boston starter had a major leagueworst erahow bad is an era through start to put it in an individual context consider that only seven pitcher have ever had a higher era in a season of or more start one of them wa the pittsburgh pirate steve blass in when he suddenly lost the ability to throw strike the mysterious condition ha since been known colloquially a steve blass diseasethe early failure of the red sox rotation is only slightly le startling than the woe of blass who had starred in the playoff the previous fall and thrown the final pitch of the world series the year before that chris sale who collected the final out for the red sox at dodger stadium last october is with a era a confounding start for a pitcher who signed a fiveyear million contract extension last monthsale ha actually not yet begun that deal it run from through while he closed out last season in a scripted moment of triumph the red sox had a fourrun lead in game and had squeezed the life from the dodger he ha not pitched more the six inning in a start since before the allstar break last july sale wa bothered by shoulder trouble down the stretch and worked just ⅓ inning in his final eight start including the postseasonthe red sox were satisfied enough with the condition of sale shoulder to give him the new contract but sale average fastball velocity ha dipped to mile per hour this season according to fangraphs down from last season he ha thrown fastball so far according to mlbcom and generated just two swinging strikesim struggling sale told reporter after tuesday loss in which he lasted just four inning i dont know if ive ever pitched like this in my lifethe red sox did not expect to worry about their rotation their starter all made relief cameo last postseason eager to contribute to a title run and expertly deployed by manager alex cora in spring training cora limited their workload even more than he had the year before with an eye on the long gamewe want them to be great the whole season but we dont want them to be in a situation where they come in april and theyre great but throughout the season theyre going down down down cora said in march every game count obviously from march all the way to the end of the regular season but we want them to be consistent and i think they understand thatwith their farm system largely depleted by trade the red sox have invested heavily in their starter sale david price rick porcello nathan eovaldi and eduardo rodriguez will combine to make about million this season more than the entire payroll of the pittsburgh pirate the baltimore oriole the miami marlin or the raysyet the red sox have met the minimum requirement for a quality start at least six inning no more than three earned run just once so far on april in oakland when sale allowed one run over six inning with only one strikeoutthere are encouraging sign the red sox bullpen minus craig kimbrel the unsigned free agent closer ha performed well with a era all of the major position player are healthy the starter have a proven track recordbut no team ha repeated a world series champion since before baseball began testing for performanceenhancing drug the toll of three postseason round without the same access to shortcut for physical recovery appears to be realfor inspiration the red sox could look to another boston team that recovered from an even worse beginning to win a championship the boston brave started yet romped to a pennant and upended the philadelphia a to win the world seriesof course history know that team a the miracle brave and it just might take another miracle for the red sox to stage an encore of the team for the agesadvertisement
advertisementsupported byon baseballby tyler kepnerthis wa always the logical blueprint for mike trout the greatest and least complicated player in baseball trout would not sell himself short financially but he also would not draw out the process of determining his future he and the los angeles angel would wait for bryce harper to set a contract record in free agency and then make a deal that would break itthat is what ha happened apparently with trout and the angel finalizing a year million contract extension with no optouts a deal that will bring the angel total commitment to nearly million for trout over the next season through the agreement which wa first reported by espn is expected to be formalized soon according to two people who had been briefed on it but were not authorized to comment publicly it is the fourth megadeal reached this spring training following those for nolan arenado eight year million with the colorado rockies manny machado year million with the san diego padre and bryce harper year million with the philadelphia philliesthose contract did little to quell the angst of the player association about the relatively subdued state of the overall free agent market the union ha become so suspicious of ownership that it ha moved some camp visit outside of clubhouse this spring training for fear of possible surveillance inside team facility the union is dismayed at the lackluster bidding for the sort of midlevel free agent who until recently had generated much more interest on the open marketwhat weve seen the last couple of year we havent seen before tony clark the union executive director said on sunday citing a climate that we dont think is sustainable for the industry a a wholethe deal for arenado machado and harper though showed that team still place a premium on elite talent and trout is the best of the best the most similar player in history at his age according to baseball reference are the hall of famers frank robinson ken griffey jr and mickey mantle trout ha won two american league most valuable player award and ha been the runnerup four time he ha a career average and is the major active leader in onbase plus slugging percentage at trout contract had been set to expire after the season and harper had publicly pushed for trout to eventually join him in philadelphia where trout attends eagle game in the offseason traveling from his nearby hometown millville nj but the angel emphasized to trout the benefit of keeping his work and home life separate and promoted the idea of being a oneteam icon in a place where he ha thrivedin an interview this month at the angel training camp in tempe ariz trout seemed content with the team new manager brad ausmus and it other offseason additionsits like a whole new start trout said i think the biggest thing is injury weve got to stay healthy top to bottom stay on the field and see where it go the chemistry great a lot of new face a lot of new coach meeting a lot of new people everybodys been great so farthe angel have reached the playoff with trout just once when they were swept by kansa city in a division series but the team is far from hopeless with a record in trout seven full season and a farm system that rank no over all according to baseball prospectus their stadium lease in anaheim run through so they could in theory open a new ballpark before trout retiresa comparison of all the major league baseball player who signed contract of at least millionsince wildly overpaying for albert pujols and josh hamilton early in this decade the angel have added highimpact player like shortstop andrelton simmons outfielder justin upton and the twoway star shohei ohtani general manager billy eppler signed catcher jonathan lucroy and pitcher cody allen trevor cahill and matt harvey to oneyear deal this winter and he ha steadily modernized the way the angel use technologystill the houston astros are the dominant team in the al west and trout could have used his clout to publicly demand that the organization do more to close the gap he never ha he said in a interview in anaheim because he belief in eppler and his lieutenantstheyre doing a good job trying to put the player in the right spot trout said then youve got to trust it there only so much that they can dohad trout played out his deal the noise around his future would only have intensified surely an unappealing prospect for a player who never court controversy yet trout is not exactly withdrawn he is readily accessible to reporter he is an active if benign presence on social medium and he might lead the league in signing autographstrout ha a few endorsement deal but doe not spend much time promoting his personal brand a source of frustration for major league baseball which would rather it best player showed more interest in marketing to trout though that ha never made much sensetrout ha always seemed to recognize how good he ha it with little incentive to disrupt that life he is dominant on the field and respected off it comfortable with the direction of his franchise happy in both southern california and southern new jersey and extremely well paid who could ask for moreif you were mike trout his agent craig landis once asked would you really wake up in the morning and say ive got to start changing thingsit wa a rhetorical question of course and trout ha now answered with a resounding no you can not blame him and you can not be surprisedadvertisement

allstar who had played his entire career for a west division team winning multiple gold glove but never reaching the world series the player wa facing the end of his contract but the cardinal hoped to persuade him to stay for many yearsthis is true of paul goldschmidt now nineteen year ago it wa true for jim edmondsthe latter partnership worked quite well edmonds who had come up with the angel signed a longterm contract during his first season in st louis led the cardinal to a division title and eventually helped them win a world series the gold glove and allstar selection kept coming for edmonds who earned the coveted red sport coat last summer a a member of the team hall of fameits cardinal baseball it the midwest it one of the best place to play in the country and you find that out from day said edmonds now a guest instructor and broadcaster for the cardinal it a different time a different era and i dont know what the player are going through now but hopefully he like it and blend in it also an organizational thing too do they really want to keep him and how doe he play this yearthe cardinal who last reached the postseason in very much want to keep goldschmidt a sixtime allstar first baseman with three gold glove they acquired him from the arizona diamondback last dec for pitcher luke weaver catcher carson kelly infielder andy young and a draft pick finally landing the highimpact slugger theyve been missinganytime you complete a deal there always some level of satisfaction especially this magnitude of player but really the excitement going to come when he get introduced at busch stadium said john mozeliak the cardinal president of baseball operation there a lot leading up to that but i think he going to realize that st louis is a very special place and ultimately one that we want him to someday call homemozeliak ha not yet spoken with goldschmidt or his agent casey close about a contract extension both side will know when the time is right he said and goldschmidt declined to comment on his future any answer he could give would be incomplete because he ha not yet experienced life a a cardinalthe team ha finished second in the national league in attendance in each of the last six season behind the los angeles dodger and ha a year streak of drawing at least million fan the diamondback have not reached million fan since when goldschmidt wa a

monday when they held their first fullsquad workout of spring training the sheet listed a few goal trust prepare execute celebrate and included three column of championship year with a conspicuously blank line beneath only one player from that world series roster catcher yadier molina remains on the team the cardinal have stayed above ever since and even won a pennant in but rival have passed

making it the past three year im itching to get back everyone deserves to get back and our fan deserve it morein the seven season since albert pujolss last in st louis before signing with the angel a a free agent no cardinal player ha hit home run with a onbase plus slugging percentage in the same season this ha been done time in those season by different player including four time by goldschmidtyet goldschmidt is more than a power hitter he ha a career average and five season of at least stolen base plus the three gold glove before reporting to camp he spoke with coach on the phone about the finer point of base runninghe actually initiated those and theyre not short conversation and theyre not forced manager mike shildt said he love it he a baseball guy and he got the detailsthe cardinal turned to shildt an organizational lifer after firing mike matheny a manager last july the player responded with a late push for a playoff spot finishing with victory and a renewed sense of identityas an organization wellknown for attention to fundamental it wa startling for the cardinal to lead the major in error yet they committed in the second half to strong defender like wong at second and harrison bader in center field and in the winter they stabilized their bullpen with a twoyear million deal for andrew millerwherever he ha gone recently boston baltimore the yankee cleveland miller team have made the playoff the cardinal have their threeyear drought but miller ha a sixyear streak he belief it will continuewhen youre at the stage of your career that i am thats where you tend to find yourself miller said the team that seek you out thats their intention not next year not five year down the road but this yearthis year for now is the extent of the cardinal

to the baseball field in a lot of way he ha a chance to really be dominant on both the offensive end and from a defensive standpointkubota said the risk of murray playing quarterback at the university of oklahoma wa worth takingfrankly were kind of excited to be an oklahoma fan for game he saideverybody know what happened next those regularseason game led to the conference title game and the orange

jackson of course did not play quarterback an allconsuming position that leaf no room for distraction to maximize his appeal to team and his potential for success murray chose football exclusively

have been a a baseball player he could always try the sport again if football fizzle a tim tebow is doing with the mets but baseball a an institution doe not give itself the best chance to attract an athlete like murray whose bonus potential wa limited by the strict draftslotting system instituted in the draft system ha always incentivized losing to some extent in and the washington national plotted a new course by taking stephen strasburg and bryce harper first over all in consecutive draft but by awarding a fixed amount of bonus money to team with the worst team getting by far the largest allowance the new rule have greatly encouraged protracted rebuildingthe houston astros understood this better than most and became a perennial power by using the system to their advantage they have spawned so many imitator that a record eight team tallied loss last seasonthe player union ha been dismayed by this trend which ha lessened demand and therefore salary for veteran free agent murray case show another regrettable consequence perhaps if the a had been able to offer more money to murray last june they could have kept him off the football field entirelyinstead their million

time to la vega to meet with bryce boras said he a guy that illustrated to harp that he about winning he very involved with his franchise and i love the fact that bryce play so well in that ballpark and see the ball so well thereof the four stadium in which he ha played the most game national park marlin park the mets citi field and the phillies citizen bank park harper ha the highest onbaseplusslugging percentage in philadelphia at he ha hit home run there his most at any park outside washingtonwhile harper ha generally struggled in los angeles ops and san francisco the value of the phillies contract understandably wa the major factor the giant could have sold harper on becoming the next barry bond a a lefthanded freeagent slugger still on the front end of his prime but they sensed the phillies would get hima lot of people thought thats where he wa going said giant manager bruce bochy who met with harper in the first of the giant visit in early february i dont think there anybody whod say they wouldnt like to have a guy like that in the lineup but i think we all felt that it seemed like thats the direction he wa headingbochy added i dont allow myself to really think about it because you cant be disappointed you dont want these guy disappointed i tell them youve got to be thankful for what you have versus what you dont havewhat harper ha is a new address in

the industry absorbs the shock wave of three new contract worth a combined millionas lucrative a they were none of those deal bryce harper to the philadelphia phillies manny machado to the san diego padre and nolan arenado remaining with the colorado rockies carried an average annual value a high a zack greinkes a he start the fourth season of his sixyear million contract with the arizona diamondback greinke still sits atop the salary pile at million per seasonjust dont ask how he feel about that at least dont ask it a a followup to another reporter question about labor issue greinke declined to answer the first question and framing the second in a personal context did not change his mindi guess that wa a good way of wording it because it almost had me answer a labor question greinke said that wa a professional questionmaybe so but it wa not effective doe it matter to him or surprise him that he still ha the game top salaryi dont want to answer it greinke said matteroffactly and that wa thatgreinke spoke on saturday at the los angeles angel minor league complex where he had thrown about pitch in a morning scrimmage he allowed a home run to jonathan lucroy golly he shouted before the ball had even cleared the fence but retired albert pujols on two grounder and a popupgreinke is a former teammate of pujolss with the angel and of lucroys with the milwaukee brewer he ha also played for the kansa city royal and the los angeles dodger he won a cy young award for the royal in and ha twice led the major in earned run averagebut greinke ha mainly been known for quiet consistency a safe bet for around victory inning and strikeout every season he almost never grant oneonone interview but his hall of fame case get louder and louder a testament to the way he combine data intuition and skill in a way few others canthe amount and information that he take in in my mind it impossible for me to try to do said zack godley a younger diamondback starter i cant fathom trying to think of all those little thing when im just trying to throw a pitch what he doe is amazing his thought process on everything is just on a different level than anyone elseto get on that level with greinke in december the diamondback had to stand out he had just opted out of his contract with the dodger after going with era the best in the major in year he wa closing in on a deal with the san francisco giant before arizona owner ken kendrick overwhelmed him eager to lift a team that had just improved by victory to greinke ha generally been excellent for the diamondback going with a era of the pitcher to make at least start in the last three season greinke is tied for ninth in era a metric that adjusts for ballpark factor and rate him a percent better than the league averagehes deserved every dollar said derrick hall the diamondback chief executive he been the pitcher we hoped hed be when we signed him it not his fault we havent gone a far a we hopedhall added in no way can we look back with any regreteven so the diamondback lost their gamble to capitalize on the prime of paul goldschmidt a star first baseman signed to a belowmarket contract the team missed the playoff in greinkes first and third season with a wildcard victory and division series loss in between and goldschmidt wa traded in december to the st louis cardinalsother star from the playoff team have left via free agency over the last two winter including starter patrick corbin and outfielder j d martinez and a j pollock the diamondback will have a payroll of roughly million this season secondhighest in their history but the team is comically topheavygreinke will make nearly five time the salary of any of his teammate the next highestpaid diamondback is outfielder david peralta at million hall said the greinke contract had made it harder to afford other premium talent but the team wa still happy to have himits definitely a factor it play in but we obviously knew that when we signed him it wa something wed be faced with way down the road hall said we hoped to cash in much sooner but we believe that in order to win you need a guy at the top of the rotation so we did not have an appetite to move zackso greinke forge on leading a rotation that also includes godley robbie ray and luke weaver who wa among those to arrive from st louis for goldschmidt greinke threw no harder than mile an hour in saturday exhibition but baffled hitter with location and movementhis changeup is the best pitch in baseball ray said ive never seen anything like it there just something about it sometimes it harder than his fastball it like but it got splitaction on it when he going good it doesnt matter if it a righty or a leftygreinke who said the changeup is so good he doe not even need to set hitter up for it also bait hitter with a curveball that puttered in at mph on saturday he said he never planned to feature that pitch a often a he now doesthat one just evolved greinke said ive gotten in more trouble in my career trying to reinvent myself before i need toreinvention is a hallmark of the great and greinke compare well to mike mussina who pushed himself to the hall of fame by constantly seeking new way to win a his fastball diminished in his s last season wa a lowlevel triumph for greinke who recovered from a wobbly april with a era thereafter dominant or something close to iti wouldnt say dominant said greinke who then paused can you say the question again i kind of stopped listening halfway and then i forgot what you started withhe wa asked to evaluate last season in which he earned his fifth allstar selection torey lovullo the diamondback manager said greinke is extremely honest and his insight is quick and to the point and greinkes selfassessment bore that outi wa feeling really bad in the spring he said i just wanted to try to put a respectable season together when i started and then my pitch started going more where i wanted and my result started to do better and i wa able to make good pitch all year over all everything worked out pretty good all the pitch were pretty crisp and location wa pretty goodjust not amazing anymore but it still pretty solid i mean better than solid ill take itnot amazing anymore but better than solid the diamondback will take it even at million per seasonadvertisement

the player can tell they know their effort go only so farwe always feel like we can win and then when it in the medium that were rebuilding it tough it almost like a fake kind of energy said scooter gennett the second baseman for the suddenly revitalized cincinnati red but now we know that they expect u to win it a lot better it a lot more real there a lot more excitement than past yearsno team arrived at spring training this year with a bigger turnaround in expectation than the red the only team in the major with at least loss in each of the last four season the red simply decided they were tired of itthey traded for the veteran starter sonny gray tanner roark and alex wood improving a rotation with a earned run average since the highest in the national league in that period they added the slugging outfielder matt kemp and yasiel puig they also hired a new manager and yes new coacheswhen they made these move that made me excited because finally i think this is our year third baseman eugenio suarez said i think this is the moment the red are going to be better why not make the playoff and win the world serieswhen you see milwaukee make the playoff last year and they made a lot of move everybody asks whats going to happen with the red why are you guy not making those move and when you see u making move this year thats what everybody wantsevery other nl central team ha reached the playoff since the red last winning season when they lost a wildcard game in pittsburgh only one player from that roster first baseman joey votto ha been with the red ever since attendance ha dropped each season at great american ball park crashing to million last year the lowest for the franchise since when the team played at riverfront stadiumthe red responded then by bringing back pete rose in late summer and making him a playermanager they hired a different cincinnati native a manager this time david bell a former infielder with strong baseball bloodline but none of rose baggagebell is a thirdgeneration red his grandfather gu wa a fourtime allstar outfielder in the s and his father buddy played infield for part of four season in the s david bell who starred at cincinnati moeller high school managed four season in the red farm system after his year playing careerits hard to explain how much it mean to do this job in cincinnati and for this organization he said you get to a point where you could probably feel that way anywhere but there just a builtin level of motivation here it inside of me it part of medick williams the red president for baseball operation said bell background wa only a bonus most impressive he said wa bell thoughtful path to the job interview after coaching for the chicago cub and the st louis cardinal he left the field to be farm director for the san francisco giantsthat wa pretty telling that he wa comfortable doing that williams said it showed me that he understood the bigger picture that nowadays in managing these team you have to understand what go on in all the different bucket so now i can interact with him and know that there an awareness from running a playerdevelopment system for a year of whats going on behind the sceneslike most team in a downturn the red traded veteran for young talent acquiring starter luis castillo and anthony desclafani that way suarez and gennett made their first allstar appearance last season suarez arrived in a trade with detroit for pitcher alfredo simon in gennett on a waiver claim from milwaukee in the red also revived their farm system with high draft pick like nick senzel who wa no over all in and could be the starting center fielder williams and the general manager nick krall also used prospect and a draft pick in trade for gray from the yankee roark from the washington national and kemp puig and wood from the dodgersthats exactly what those prospect are for to help u take a step forward williams said i think we have a chance this year but just a importantly it this feeling of emerging from the rebuild and a feeling for the guy in this clubhouse that the front office is behind them and trying to do thing to winthe coaching hire williams said were critical to that effort catcher curt casali called it a rockstar coaching staff which includes two member from last year nl championship series turner ward the former dodger hitting coach and derek johnson the former brewer pitching coach who worked with gray at vanderbiltthey felt like we could do it sooner rather than later johnson said referring to his conversation with the red front office it didnt seem like it had to be a four or fiveyear experiment where were figuring it out a we go they were unified from that standpointpart of the plan is a more sophisticated use of technology including camera and radar device by edgertronic and rapsodo to provide instant feedback on player movement the forwardthinking houston astros helped set this trend and the red hope they have caught upwere in the loop now casali said were trying to be progressive and give ourselves the best chance of competingthe red still face a rigorous challenge in the nl central where every team expects to contend if the red fall far behind by midsummer they will be tempted to trade wood kemp puig and roark who can all be free agent after the seasonbut for the first time in several year the red do not have to pretend they will not be division favorite but they are hopeful that count for somethingyou dont do everything based on well it raise my playoff odds this much but not this much so maybe williams said hey it give u a better chance let go it timea picture caption with an earlier version of this article reversed it identification david bell the manager is on the right joey votto is on

the rest of your lifesometimes that happens oh yeah definitely said kyle schwarber the chicago cub left fielder before an exhibition game the other day were not here always trying to take advantage of people but it a nice gesture and we get it we always make sure we try to take care of emon the field the cub have continued rewarding fan since their magical championship run in they have returned to the playoff in each of the two season since part of a fouryear stretch in which they have won more game than any other major league team with but the standard have changed in chicago where the front office wonder how much more it can get from this core the cub win regular season felt awfully empty after it crashed and burned in a twoday fiasco at wrigley field last october first the milwaukee brewer stole the national league central crown in a onegame playoff and then the colorado rockies eliminated the cub in a inning wildcard gamei think everybody including me we were trying to do everything ourselves instead of a a team second baseman javier baez said you only make it harder for u and for the team i think we waited until the season wa over to look at it and try to make the adjustment but obviously there wa no game that daythe cub were the first team kicked off the postseason stage which became another showcase for theo epstein former team the boston red sox who won their fourth championship this century epstein influence on that roster remains mookie betts jackie bradley jr and xander bogaerts all signed while he wa general manager but his cub lack a companion piece for their trophyto get it epstein the cub president of baseball operation brought back nearly the entire roster from dropping no significant player and adding only at the margin infielder daniel descalso and reliever brad brach and xavier cedeno but this group will run out of chance epstein said if it continues to struggle a it did down the stretchin the second half we completely fell apart offensively epstein said we went to the worst quartile you can be in we were hitting the ball softly hitting the ball on the ground striking out not walking and not getting on base we went from exactly where you want to be in the first half to exactly where you dont want to bewe still havent really put our finger on itit wa probably an anomaly epstein said but he added an ominous warning if not then were not who we think we are and well have to make sweeping change well find that out this seasonepstein underscored that urgency in november by announcing that he would not discus a contract extension for manager joe maddon at least not for nowive always believed if you do your job thing take care of themselves ive always worked from that premise said maddon the former tampa bay manager who earns million per year on a deal that expires after this season ive worked on oneyear deal in the minor league and my first deal with the ray had a twoyear option so ive been there beforeim really not concerned and quite frankly i feel actually pretty good about it it an interesting situation to be in but i really anticipate being here for a long time i know from the outside in im going to get a lot of these question but the best way i can answer it is just like what im talking about owning it now staying focused in the present tense thats the best way to handle any situationthere ha been more than usual to handle off the field this offseason for the cub shortstop addison russell wa given a game suspension for domestic violence late last season with game still to be served in february the news outlet splinter published a cache of racist email sent and received by joe ricketts the billionaire patriarch of the family that owns the cub that focused on fear of muslim and contained conspiracy theory about former president barack obamaepstein gave a lengthy condemnation of ricketts email at the start of spring training and russell opened camp by saying he wa not proud of the person he wa and apologizing to his exwife melisai want to own my action russell said last month i want to be accountable for the hurt that i put melisa through and the pain that she went through thats what i want to ownmaddon who combine newage charisma with a deep background in scouting and coaching ha taken that verb own and made it the latest in a series of annual slogan he us to guide the playersthe motto officially is own it now you see it everywhere at spring training from the player tshirts to the wifi password for the complex maddon said he heard the broadcaster tony romo use own it to describe his approach to calling the super bowlim sitting around one day and im trying to come up with my thought and i wrote down own now and won and theyre all generated from the same letter maddon said the phrase is pretty prominent in general these day to own itpart of maddons task this season he said is to coach the coach even more referring to a group that includes a new bench coach mark loretta new pitching coach tommy hottovy and two new hitting coach anthony iapoce and terrmel sledgeiapoce who worked with schwarber kris bryant and others a a cub minor league instructor wa most recently a coach for three season with the texas ranger in each of those year the ranger hit more home run than the cub who led the nl in batting average and hit last season but had their fewest homer since when they finished in last placetheres a lot of stud in this room that have had plenty of good year before said bryant a former most valuable player who hit just homer in game a he dealt with a shoulder injury last season we know the talent we have here a lot of allstars a lot of world series champion guy who have been around for a long timeone of those player the lefthander cole hamels thrived after arriving in a trade from texas last july hamels had a era in start a better cub debut than his former ranger teammate yu darvish who made just eight start with a era because of elbow and triceps injurieshes lightning in a bottle because when he is on hitter are not putting the ball in play hamels said of darvish he got that swingandmiss stuff and if youre able to do that especially in the national league youre getting through seven eight inning right on to the closerdarvish who signed a sixyear million contract before last season belief he can pitch like that again or maybe even better after two sharp inning against the chicago white sox on sunday darvish declared im the best right now in my careerwhybecause im throwing my slider wa really good and my split wa good too darvish said thats the best stuff in my lifemaybe that wa typical spring training hyperbole but after one of the leastsatisfying win season in major league history the cub could use a little optimism they might a well own it nowadvertisement
advertisementsupported byon baseballby tyler kepnerwest palm beach fla call it the strange but true feat of this frigid baseball offseason an allstar free agent drew interest from several team one team reached to make a better offer than the others the player signed and the whole saga wa over before the winter meetingsi wa fortunate to have a lot of team that were competitive and wanted to win now which wa exciting to have that many team come after me said the player patrick corbin now a proud and wealthy member of the washington national it kind of made it a fun processthe process ha confounded many of his peer with several dozen free agent including many former allstars still unsigned but corbin a lefthanded starter did just fine he joined the national on dec for six year and million a deal more than twice a lucrative a the next richest on this winter freeagent market nathan eovaldis fouryear million contract to stay with the boston red soxcorbin also had offer from the los angeles angel the philadelphia phillies and the yankee the team corbin rooted for while growing up near syracuse knowing this the national separated themselves the oldfashioned way by offering corbin a longer more valuable deal than their rivalsthere were other team that were more poised to get him if we werent aggressive and we really wanted him said mike rizzo the national general manager a he watched his pitcher throw in the bullpen friday in west palm beach we extended on him and we got the player if we didnt wed be looking back and saying we werent going to go there and now we dont have the player corbin who ha one of baseball best slider worked inning for the arizona diamondback last season with strikeout and a earned run average maybe he will still be a top pitcher in maybe not but he wa the best pitcher on the market this winter and rizzo wanted the best he wa willing to be a little uncomfortable to get corbin he said and the clubhouse is gratefulwhen i signed i wa like man he going to do something big right here and my agent told me that too said kurt suzuki a veteran catcher who signed for two year and million in late november and when they got corbin i wa like there you go no pitcher on the freeagent market it wa the second time rizzo had done this suzuki added mentioning max scherzer who received a sevenyear million deal with the national in january sixteen month later the team extended starter stephen strasburgs contract by seven year and million the national hoped to pay outfielder bryce harper even more and it wa widely reported that they offered him a year million deal at the end of the seasonharper on the verge of free agency decided to explore his market value the national pulled the offer and moved on quickly by the end of december they had added corbin and anibal sanchez to the rotation kyle barraclough and trevor rosenthal to the bullpen and suzuki and yan gomes a catcher second baseman brian dozier signed on jan in an offseason of inertia for many team the national have sprinted to spring trainingi kind of feel like were the only organization thats doing that said scherzer an outspoken critic of team that do not try to win it great to play for an organization where ownership front office and management identified what they wanted to change and then went out and did it thats what you want to play forharper like shortstop manny machado wa expected to command a record contract on the open market a sixtime allstar harper helped lead washington to four division title and won the national league most valuable player award in rizzo played three season a a minor league infielder and spent decade a a scout he appreciates the rarity of major league talent and said it wa important to treat these guy with respect and dignity to that end he made sure to put a value on harper and give him a chance to stay but he would not let harper free agency handcuff the team planswe made it clear to him he wa loved here and we wanted him to stay here rizzo said we felt that since he our player we have this window to figure out if we can get a deal done but we also had to put an expiration date on it because how do you do other business if you dont have an expiration date on that offerthat doesnt mean that we cant circle back and do something another time including now but we felt that harp wa our primary goal and we had a strategy and a plan put together to make him a good fair offer rizzo continued but we felt that the expiration date on that wa a important because once free agency started we had to be able to go out and look at other avenue with the mindset that we could always circle back if we had tophotographs of harper still line the hallway outside the national clubhouse in west palm beach but to get him through the door both side will need to be creative the national are the only team with three contract worth at least million that all extend beyond including corbins the only true bonanza of baseball bewildering endless winterit wa a perfect storm of situation where it all worked out corbin said we were ready we thought it wa a good fit for u here and wanted to get it done and i think they did a well it worked out for both side i guess thats how a good deal worksadvertisement

to st louis early in the season preacher roe a sly and slender lefty who had just retired to west plain mo entertained his former teammate at the chase hotel he needed their advicewe sat around a big table all talking to preacher recall carl erskine a top dodger starter then he said fella i want to ask you a question sport illustrated ha offered me to tell them how i threw the spitter you think i should do that or not with that i can blacktop my driveway and i can fix up my house i could really use that what do you thinkthe guy all said yeah go ahead preach sure why not i did not i admired preacher he wa a great study to watch pitch he wa very clever and won a lot of game he wa really a pitcher pitcher so i didnt say yes to that a we were leaving the dining room preacher said i didnt hear you speak up i said no i didnt preacher you were such an outstanding pitcher without the spitter id hate to see you taint your whole career by talking about throwing itso anyway preacher did the article he got the and sometime later when i talked to preach he said carl you know what i just ruined my chance for the hall of fame by admitting i threw the spitter and youre the only one that advised me not to do it and i said well preacher i saw you pitch you were a pitcher pitcher you could have won without the spittermaybe maybe not while erskine believed in roe the man himself didnt in his confession roe said he turned to the pitch after slumping to with the pirate in reviving the spitter which he had practiced with harry brecheen a a cardinal farmhand wa his last chance he made the most of it becoming a regular allstar though not quite a cooperstown candidate for the dodger cheating only made sensewhy shouldnt i have roe told dick young in the sport illustrated article i wa about through when i decided to get me the pitch if i get caught i told myself theyll kick me out if i dont im through anyway so how can i losehe didnt lose very often roe won so much he had a winning percentage over seven season with brooklyn that he guessed the spitter had earned him on the bench between inning roe would pop a stick of beechnut gum into his mouth and announce im going to get me a new batch of curveballs in the game hed spit on the meaty part of his thumb while pretending to wipe his brow then while hitching his belt hed subtly wipe his index and middle finger on the saliva two wet finger on top a dry thumb underneath and roe wa ready he compared it to squeezing a peach pit or a watermelon seed with your fingertipsthe idea is to get part of your grip wet and the other dry he said when the ball leaf your hand it slip off your wet finger and cling just tinylike to the dry part of your thumb the ball jump on account of it if it a good un it drop like a dead duck just when it cross the plateroes confession only confirmed his reputation a stan musial wrote decade later id always be firstpitch hitting against roe because when he had two strike on you hed usually load up and i hated to get a shower anticipation of the spitter helped roe and he knew how to destroy evidence he wa never caught in the actthe umpire would call for the ball and preacher would stomp around and look at his hand like uhoh you probably got me this time erskine say and then instead of tossing the ball in hed roll it to the umpire on the groundlike steroid user decade later roe stayed ahead of the cop and thrived but his pang of regret to erskine at least for going public and bursting his cloud of mystery showed that he knew what he had done the specter of the dark art would indeed follow roe to his grave when he died in the word spitball appeared in the headline of his new york time obituaryafter two chaotic decade or so the spitball wa banned for the same year the country went dry under prohibition the rule simply turned the mound into a speakeasy with many pitcher going undercover to get the same slippery edge a their predecessorsthe physic behind the spitball is simple enough when the ball slide off wet finger it loses backspin and therefore rotates le something like a knuckleball which should not rotate at all or a forkball tumbling in it final plungedefacing the surface of a ball produce the same kind of effect added movement to the opposite side of the scuff this also date to the game early day imagine what the baseball looked like in the early th centurywed play a whole game with one ball if it stayed in the park wahoo sam crawford a hall of famer who played from to say in the glory of their time a book by lawrence s ritterlopsided and black and full of tobacco and licorice stain crawford continues the pitcher used to have it all their way back theneven the possibility of scuffing give pitcher an edge these word come from chet brewer a star for the kansa city monarch of the negro national league in the late s and they sound timelessa cut ball i got credit for that he told john holway in the book black diamond if i picked up a rough one i didnt throw it out of the game i didnt exactly put the cut on it myself but i could pitch itscuffing charge never dogged mike mussina a hall of fame righthander for the oriole and the yankee from to but like any smart pitcher he would never reject a ball that came to him with a mark this wa mussinas order for every catcher if a ball scrape the ground never volunteer it to the umpiresay a guy hit a ground ball to short and they throw it back to me from first base a soon a i grab the ball im running my thumb over these mussina say he is holding a ball and referring to the white area within the horseshoe do i have a sinker out of this ball and if i find one i think pretty good i flip it to the other side to see if it scuffed up on the wrong sideby that he mean the opposite side if both horseshoe area are scuffed theyll counteract each other to no advantage if there a scuff where the seam narrow the sweet spot it creates a fourseam sinker a pitch that spin like a straight fastball but veers away in the direction opposite the scuffa common lament among retired pitcher is that too many ball are now thrown out of play to them it underscore a lack of craftsmanship on the moundive literally seen teammate when there a scuff on the ball they get rid of it say jamie moyer who won game in a career that ended in the year he turned theyll say oh it doe funny stuff and you go wait a minute that funny stuff can be a benefit to youhitters are conditioned now to ask umpire to discard any ball that skip umpire and catcher know this so catcher tend to have an almost reflexive response they will spear a ball from the dirt transfer it quickly to their throwing hand and hold it up for the ump to keep or rejectof course some fielder still try to create a scuff catcher may deliberately shorthop their throw before inning and outfielder may do the same on routine throw to the infield but time have changedwhen i played a ball hit the dirt it wa still in play say chili davis the mets hitting coach who played from to today game if a catcher throw a ball down to second on a short hop or a ball get blocked in the dirt that ball out of the game it just automatic nowpitchers also seek way to look natural while applying moisture or tackiness to their finger one former player now a broadcaster reached into his team ball bag for me and pulled out a canister of colorless tufskin a spray that help secure athletic tape with one spritz of tufskin on my arm i had an invisible island of instant tackiness for my fingersthats also why pitcher like putting clear bullfrog sunscreen on their arm grab the rosin bag aimlessly touch the bullfrog spot and youll have just enough stickiness to help guide your pitch one catcher say he ha seen pitcher leave the dugout between inning and wrap their finger around a ball coated with pine tar leaving just enough residue on their hand to get a better grip when they return to the moundnext time you go to a game notice all the surface a pitcher touch with his hand pitcher are fidgety creature constantly tugging and swiping and scratching their cap their sleeve their skin something corey kluber the twotime cy young award winner for cleveland grab his tongue on the mound before every pitch which became legal again year ago then wipe his hand on the side of his pantsthe way they rub the ball up now they rub them up all in advance kluber say theyre not rubbed up all day and they sit in the bucket with all the dust and stuff and they get so slippery just get a little bit of moisture on your hand at least youve still got to wipe it off obviously but you get a little bit of moisture on your hand so the ball not a drykluber doe this no matter the weather but such tactic are especially handy in the cold and at high altitude where it harder to generate moisturei tell you what say one year veteran if they could get a camera behind the dugout in colorado it would be like a mad scientist laboratory down there people doing anything they can to find a gripmost player even hitter tend to accept this practice a pitch can be an instrument of destruction after all and a hitter would rather the pitcher know where it going than accidentally fire a cue ball at his head it is a fine distinction to be sure but this is the logic tackiness help command and finish on a pitch and thats ok sandpaper or ky jelly help enhance movement and thats notin the cold weather in minnesota you had to have something to grip the curveball say jim kaat who starred for the twin in the s pitcher for year have lobbied if hitter can use pine tar to grip the bat better it doesnt help em hit it any farther we should be able to use pine tarthen again it come back to discretion in when the yankee michael pineda brazenly smeared pine tar on his neck on a chilly night at fenway park it wa so overt that the red sox felt compelled to object pineda got a game suspension and widespread ridicule but generally a long a a pitcher is discreet the other side ha no problem with pine tarpine tar is one thing cheating by the letter of the law yes but not by the spirit whatever happened to the spitball the hall of fame pitch of jack chesbro and ed walsh stan coveleski and red faber burleigh grime and gaylord perry richie ashburn who had the most hit of the s always thought of pitcher a shifty character never to be trustedwhere have all the scoundrel gonewhen i asked perry in why more pitcher were not a shall we say crafty a they were in his day he had a short but telling answer well maybe they dont need it dan plesac who pitched in more than game agreedyoure not looking for a don sutton now a guy that can sink it and cut it and make the ball move plesac say if you dont have velocity you cant pitch anymore how many guy how many real power pitcher need to scuff the ball to be successful not many you dont need to if your stuff is that goodplesac work for mlb network founded in the hub of baseball vast and everexpanding visual empire every fan can watch game

that look really abnormal the team video analyst rewinds it time ok what did he do different oh he went to the side of his pant he went to his belt he went to the top of his hat then they start to put together the timeline of every time he pitched doe that ball do the same thing what about his last start his start before that and before you know it theyve got it down all right go tell the umpire to check his hat or check the side of his pant or check inside his glove you cant hide anymorebut what if you could what if the next preacher roe or gaylord perry wa hiding in plain sight on a diamond

advertisementsupported bysports of the timesby michael powelljust for kick i listened a brodie van wagenen the mets general manager went on about signing the oftinjured yearold second baseman jed lowrie and reporter sounded entranced by his jivehave you they asked thought of bidding on outfielder bryce harper or infielder manny machado the two young star free agent who improbably have attracted not much attention this wintervan wagenen a smoothtalking agent who ha become a smoothtalking general manager smiled genially let be candid here he said the outfield is probably not our top priority at this point jeff mcneil a career minor leaguer until last july wa going out to the outfield van wagenen said and he give u another really good weaponthat the mets a little market club hard by flushing bay will play it cheap is a wellestablished fact but van wagenen speaks the management palaver of choice this parsimonious winter no one want to spend moneythe cub the yankee the dodger the giant the cardinal the brave the ranger and the angel all have apparently passed on making a bid for harper and machado each franchise is owned by a wealthy man or family in a wealthladen sport and all could presumably find a place in the lineup for one of these young star and yet for the second season in a row at a time of the offseason when the best free agent typically would have already signed handsome new contract most owner have tucked away their wallet and claimed to need no more talentcandidly van wagenens reasoning for the mets disinterest is good for a giggle mcneil is a lateblooming minor league second baseman who in a few nice month in the major hit three home run and knocked in run he a career infielder without a career to speak ofharper by way of no comparison last season hit home run walked time scored run and knocked in he is a former rookie of the year and league mvp and he all of to suggest you will pas on harper in hope that mcneil find his outfield leg is with no offense intended to the mcneil family whackedmachado and harper are not the only quality free agent left flapping in the wind dallas keuchel a good starting pitcher and mike moustakas a fine third baseman who hit homer last year have elicited little interest craig kimbrel that world champion red sox closer with save give him a call hed probably like to chat yasmani grandal the best catcher on the market wa expected to command a multiyear contract he could scrounge up no better than a oneyear million deal with the milwaukee brewersthe major league baseball player association project at least of baseball team will start with a substantially lower payroll than only four or five are expected to show a significant increase player are well past concerned bruce meyer the union director of collective bargaining told me at a time when industry revenue and club valuation are growing for the second straight offseason an alarming number of club are declining to compete for the many talented playersmajor league baseball official claim to see no problem the deputy commissioner dan halem helped negotiate the last collective bargaining agreement with the player union and he say labor portion of nearly billion in baseball revenue ha held steady his estimate includes player in baseball vast minor league system though none of whom are in the union and some fair number of whom thanks to baseball lobbying with congress make le than the minimum wagebaseball drove down a road that looked suspiciously like this one between and and that ended in a multicar collision with three separate finding that it owner had engaged in illegal collusion to hold down player salary the owner paid penalty of million plus interest to the player and in the s the sport weathered brutal strike that owed to the residual bitternessthe former baseball commissioner fay vincent appointed by the owner and no marxist wa moved at that time to remark to the owner the single biggest reality you guy have to face up to is collusion you stole million from the player and the player are unified to a man around that issue because you got caught and many of you are still involvedi posse no proof the current generation of extremely rich owner have acted a stupidly a their predecessor for now the flaccid freeagent market is simply oddthe management of this column readily acknowledges the best of the marooned free agent will not be left to scratch nickel together harper seek a contract north of million for year and machado entered free agency entranced by similar sugarplum vision it is all but assured that one day their descendant will decant a fine bordeaux and offer a heartfelt thanksgiving toast to dear old grandpa bryce and mannyand so what megawatt talent in many profession profit handsomely a point lost on a writer from bleacher report who loosened an ancient grouse these free agent are paid silly money to play a childrens gameyes and playing pretend a a child can lead to movie stardom and an adolescent toeshoed spin can lead to the city ballet provided you have great talent and a work ethic to matchi digressbaseball official justify the new parsimony with a bow to analytics we will not sign this or that star because we or some other team once paid out a bad contract this player became too old this one too slow that one too bald and the thought of a bad contract give u a stomachachegeneral manager are extremely analytical and they tend a a group to make the most efficient decision possible mlbs halem told mesix year ago the angel gave albert pujols a year million contract and that indeed edged to frontier of nuttiness he wa when he signed it and already past his prime his oncefabulous eye for ball and strike slowly deserted him and a man who once led the league in hitting ha not surmounted the past two season with year to go pujolss contract is a mothball specialharper and machado are not pujols each man is entering his golden prime and with a reasonable expectation they will produce at a high level for many season to comethe owner have perhaps snookered a baseball union grown a touch complacent they regularly manipulate the service time of young player which work this way team control player for six season before they become eligible for free agency so club put thumb to scale and wait to bring up even their very best player until late may or early june this push back the rookie service time and save the club many million of dollarsthe difference when a player reach free agency is grand in harper led the league with homer and a on base percentage and wa voted the national league most valuable player he earned million next year he is likely to pull down close to millionthe union ha tended to tolerate service manipulation figuring it member would recoup any lost money in free agency unlike football and basketball baseball ha no salary cap it also ha no floor though and now owner are squeezing player on either end like so many papaya in a juicerbaseball owner and the abacus boy would do well not to grow selfsatisfied attendance took a decided drop last year and the lack of a competitive market ha set player in pro sport most powerful union to grumbling christian yelich this year national league mvp stopped by the new york time last week and said player are talking about the strange sloth in the freeagent markettheyre two of the best player that we have in the game he said the process hasnt played outlast winter amid another slow freeagent market dodger closer kenley jansen tossed a high fastball at

of a miracle the mets forever young in their mind will be honored at the new york baseball writer dinner mingling with star of today mookie betts jacob degrom christian yelich who are young enough to be their grandsonswhen i first went to the mets casey stengel wa there cleon jones the left fielder said by telephone from mobile ala and casey stengel wa or year of age thats what i am now and i looked at him a an old man but i dont see myself a an old man even now when you go back and look at all those thing all of it is so clear like it wa just yesterdayjones made his major league debut near the end of the mets second season in existence on sept at the polo ground the mets under stengel who retired two year later at lost that day for their th defeat of the season yet in with nothing but failure in their brief and bumbling history they won game and then stormed to an unlikely championshipit is hard to imagine given today dreary landscape of new york team that the mets title came in the middle of three local championship connected to the jet won the super bowl in january and a the mets were thumping baltimore in the world series the knicks were starting their schedule which ended in a titleit wa probably the most incredible year for professional sport in the history of new york art shamsky an outfielder for the mets said recently and for u personally part of the story is not so much that we won but where we came from even the year before wed finished ninthshamsky ha written a book about the new york sport scene and ha another coming out in march after the miracle the lasting brotherhood of the mets written with erik sherman shamsky is from st louis and last played for the mets in but he still life in new yorkwhen i first got traded here i didnt like new york he said i wa playing with the red and the city wa too big the mets were not a good team i wa a little despondent but i fell in love with the city moved into manhattan and of course when you win a championship it an easy decision to stay people still remember it which i find incredibleor maybe not so much in the year since the mets have won just one more world series in over boston it wa another miraculous victory for the mets after they were down to their final out trailing by two run with the base empty in game the two championship featured an onlyinbaseball kind of symmetry the pitcher on the mound at the end of the world series jerry koosman wa eventually traded for jesse orosco who closed out the title and the manager of the mets davey johnson made the last out for the oriole in a fly ball to jones in left fieldhad johnson ball cleared the fence the oriole would have tied game just a the mets mike piazza would have tied game against the yankee in if his long fly drive to center had gone out but both ball produced just a fleeting glimmer of hope like bernie williams in jones had it all the waydavey johnson said it the hardest ball he ever hit and he didnt know why it stayed in the ballpark but when the ball went up i knew it wa an out jones said thats my claim to fame the last out and the kneeling praying come on down baby come on down people associate me with that so everywhere i go thats what they do get in position to catch the ball and get on one kneejones had never done that before he said but then again he had never caught a ball that meant so much he gave it to koosman later in the clubhouse celebration nobody besides ed kranepool cared much about memorabilia back then jones saidkranepool will be there with jones shamsky ron swoboda and

died too younggil hodges the manager would be now he died of a heart attack just before the season jones said hodges had convinced the young mets that they could win if they minimized mistake and got player to accept platoon role for the greater goodhad it been anybody else a the manager yogi berra or wes westrum even casey stengel you wouldnt be talking about the mets jones said referring to other mets manager we won because of our leader which wa gil hodgesjones clashed with berra in his stormy season his last in new york marked by a batting average and a humiliating news conference in which the owner m donald grant forced him to apologize for a misdemeanor charge later dropped for lack of evidence when he wa found sleeping in a van with a woman while recovering from knee surgery in

batting average over game is a speechwriterthis week the baseball hall of fame will announce a new class of inductee setting off round of celebration and debate fan will argue over whether mariano rivera deserves unanimous approval or whether the use of performanceenhancing drug should permanently block the enshrinement of barry bondsoddly amid these debate one of the hall of fame key omission is likely to be overlooked how is it that it ha left out and perhaps not even discussed the man who ha had the greatest influence on baseball in the last year who ha changed how the game is understood how it is enjoyed and even how it is played im talking about the statistician and historian bill jamesa graduate of the university of kansa james began his professional involvement with baseball in the late s while working night a a security guard at a cannery when not foiling porkandbean burglary he used his free time to record and analyze baseball statistic he had a quirky curiosity that led him to ask offbeat question whose answer he extracted from the number he kept he wasnt afraid to deflate reputation or debunk conventional wisdom he turned his finding into article and eventually bestselling book his writing wa smart funny contentious and unlike anything fan had ever readit may be hard for younger fan to grasp how innumerate baseball wa there were homer and rbi and batting

williams lose more homer playing in fenway park than joe dimaggio lost playing in yankee stadium james did his best work reevaluating reputation he showed that the infielder famous for diving catch actually lacked range that the genius manager who strategically bunted wa actually squandering out that more of your favorite slugger homer could be ascribed to close fence than to his prodigious powerjames revealed a game in which your eye deceived you a banjohitting second baseman who walked a lot wa a bigger offensive asset than the longball threat who struck out a lot the wily catcher who knew how to frame pitch might be more responsible for strikeout than the pitcher who threw themjames did not invent analytics other student of the game formed the society for american baseball

the early s we were part of a group that attended an ordinary game at shea stadium between a poor new york mets team and the firstplace los angeles dodger james wa a typical fan he drank a beer he did the wave but he also carried a bedraggled notebook in which he recorded the lineup and the game condition drew stick figure showing the pitcher windup and noted every pitch that wa thrownwe were in the middle of a scoreless game when james did something astounding the dodger pitcher had just recorded out no for the inning and james said the mets are going to score this inning yeah right i thought one out nobody on average hitter coming up but then yes the mets scored and again and again the dodger starter took pitch to retire the first hitter james explained pitcher usually need pitch to get through a whole inning with the pitcher faltering he said the mets chance dramatically increasedthis year watch any game and you will almost certainly hear the announcer discus spin ratio exit velocity win above replacement and other analytical concept team will shift defender arrange lineup substitute player and choose pitch all based on the number you may even gripe about the

contract with the phillies harper will be both hailed a a savior and held to nearly impossible standard if he sign somewhere else he will be a pariahmaybe harper simply want no part of the phillies or maybe he is just waiting for their owner john middleton to blow past the year million agreement manny machado reached this week with the san diego padre a harper and his agent scott boras take their time the phillies are not dangling a blank checkthe most important thing for any organization is to have continuity and a consensus from ownership through management phillies general manager matt klentak said on wednesday in his office at spectrum field after a long day of meeting we know what were willing to do and we know what were not willing to do and everybodys on boardthe phillies loved machado perhaps even more than they do harper they tried to trade for machado last summer they met with him in person this winter and they offered him a lucrative deal but would not go to million the phillies might do so for harper but insist they will not act out of desperationmiddleton did give that impression in november when he told bob nightengale of usa today that the team wa expecting to spend money and maybe even be a little stupid about it the phillies have spent money but they have not been stupidafter stumbling down the stretch to an finish last season the phillies have added four highimpact player all with allstar pedigree left fielder andrew mccutchen catcher jt realmuto reliever david robertson and shortstop jean segura they signed their ace aaron nola to a fouryear million contract extension and added other reliever in tradesthe move improved a dreadful defense and a lineup that produced the fewest hit in the major last season they were prudent responsible move but middleton statement wa widely viewed a a promise of something bolder setting up a binary view of the phillies winter success machado or harper or failure anything elseim well aware of the perception this offseason klentak said i would shift the focus to the body of work in our offseason weve spent about million this offseason weve spent plenty of money this is not an ownership that is sitting on it hand and going cheapso far the phillies biggest freeagent splash wa a threeyear million contract for mccutchen a former most valuable player for the pittsburgh pirate mccutchen will play left field with the slugger rhys hoskins shifting back to first base his best position carlos santana who played first base last year went to the seattle mariner in a deal for segura who hit with steal last season and once led the national league in hitsi think we have the piece to go a far a we want to and thats to the championship mccutchen said it a very strong team all around you look at the lineup and there some good name in there and the pitching unreal i remember facing these guy when i wa on the giant and looking at the starting rotation and the bullpen i wa like man theyve got some arm there no break herein realmuto who arrived this month in a trade with the miami marlin the phillies have the major best catcher robertson solidifies a deep bullpen the phillies seem comfortable with their rotation nola jake arrieta nick pivetta vince velasquez and zach eflin but if they lose out on harper they could theoretically upgrade that groupwe are always going to be openminded to opportunity to make our team better klentak said but this is not the last freeagent class of all time there will be other opportunity for the philadelphia phillies to spend money in the future whether it july at the trade deadline or next offseason or the offseason after that we have to take that into accountare there player remaining in free agency that would make u better are we going to have need next year and are there going to be player in next year class that were going to want to sign yes we have to balance the short term and the long term in everything that we dothe phillies longterm fantasy is to sign mike trout if he leaf the los angeles angel a a free agent after the season but trout an unabashed philadelphia sport fan from millville nj might never hit the open market and with realmuto under team control for only the next two season the phillies shortterm window is open harper could help them burst through iti think were a good team with or without adding harper robertson said obviously he a great player and fit in on any roster who wouldnt want a guy thats capable of hitting home run and hitting but you cant look at stuff like that were in the nowthe player seem to understand that for now the fan are preoccupied with one guy not in that room harperto me personally i dont really care but i think for the city they want a guy like that reliever pat neshek said with all the talk i feel like theyre expecting one of the two and now mannys gone but theyre trying their best theyve made awesome move so far and the nl east is going to be tough no matter whatit is hard to see clearly now with the harper haze hanging over the team and the sport but what if the phillies have done enough already with mccutchen realmuto robertson and segura that is their stance and they might be rightin a typical offseason that is a very thorough complete and successful offseason klentak said we addressed everything we wanted to addressadvertisement

wa a a pitching staff and we stuck to it and it got u one game awayburnes is auditioning for a starting role now just like freddy peralta and brandon woodruff who also pitched mostly in relief a rookie last october that trio helped set up another josh hader jeremy jeffress and corey knebelhader jeffress and knebel formed a postmodern mashup of randy johnson jr richard and nolan ryan together they fanned batter in just ⅓ inning they have all been allstars within the last two year and manager craig counsell ha taught them to be ready for anythingevery out is one of the most important out of the game knebel said every inning is a save situation and thats the way counsell teach itstill counsell know he can not manage from april through august the way he did in september with expanded roster and october with regular offdays even so no brewer ha thrown a complete game since jimmy nelson in june or worked inning in a season since yovani gallardo in great starting pitcher are still the manager best friend said counsell though he added that his job is simply to find the best way to get out it your personnel who are your player and what are they good at how do they connect to each otherthe brewer only other playoff team since included former cy young award winner they had rented through trade c c sabathia in and zack greinke in last year ace jhoulys chacin joined milwaukee in the offseason on a bargain contract two year million and thrived by following the brewer suggestion to throw more slider chacin who wa wa the only brewer to work the required inning to qualify for the era titlein relying mostly on chacin and the nowdeparted wade miley a postseason starter miley faced just one batter a a decoy in game against the dodger counsell bypassed some mainstay who helped the brewer get there chase anderson zach davy and junior guerra combined for start the last two season but were afterthought in the playoffsi tried to be the best teammate i could but i knew i wasnt going to be on the roster said anderson who wa with a era im more of an optimistic person than a pessimistic person thats my personality but when you get down to it i wanted to be out there a much a anybodybeing here since seeing that rebuilding process expedited faster than people thought yeah it wa hardanderson revamped his mechanic over the winter and studied video of mike mussina the hall of fame righthander whose precision and creativity he admires he is competing with davy burnes peralta woodruff and the former cleveland righthander josh tomlin for rotation spot behind chacin with nelson a bit behind a he recovers from a shoulder injurydavies a former game winner said his goal wa to work inning that number remains a point of pride for starter but very few get to do it any more just pitcher reached inning last season down from in team like the brewer the oakland athletics and especially the tampa bay ray with their opener strategy want quality over quantity from startersas an industry weve learned it really tough to consistently pitch seven eight nine inning effectively so the rope is unquestionably shorter brewer general manager david stearns said having said that every organization is looking for multiple pitcher who can do that and every organization will give a guy a chance if he show that abilityi mean the ray have been the most aggressive in the opener paradigm and they still have blake snell and every organization i would imagine would love to have blake snell and would use his skill set to the maxthe brewer hope to find an ace like snell the american league cy young award winner among burnes peralta or woodruff who combined for a era in the nlcs with strikeout in ⅓ inning starter use a wider array of pitch than reliever though so it is fair to ask if those three can be quite a dominant in the rotationthats the question that we have to answer counsell said but it their time to do it and were always going to need player at that stage of their career to take the next stepthis is the th season for the brewer in milwaukee and they still have not taken that final step a they try to do it they will continue to seek creative way to get outsit kind of challenge your thinking counsell said and you end up finding better answersadvertisement

were available the ranger signed rodriguez to a record million year contract and the red sox landed ramirez for eight year at millionwhether contract like these are worth it for team is open to debate

thereramirez led the american league in homer in the season in which boston won it first world series title since one way to determine how well big contract work out for team is to measure a player

yearly salary avg yearly salaryof these contractsavg yearly salaryof these contractsevaluating contract while there are many way to value a player contribution war is a single metric aimed at comparing player across different era position and ballparksno one metric is without it limitation but there little doubt that albert pujolss first million contract worked out a lot better for the cardinal than the homer bailey deal worked out for the redscosting more producing le pujols versus bailey aside value argument can be made for and against player in every corner of this chart even those in the redhighlighted boxthe player in the red box cost more per year than the average of all these million player but have produced le than the average war of these playersthe worst deal there is a strong case that the phillies contract with ryan howard is one of the worst of all he had a respectable average war of in the eight season before his big contractbut he had a negative war in four of the five season during the contract injury played a big role in that but injury are among the risk of big contractstheres still time these contract are still active so underperforming player have time to prove their worth just ask david pricethe david price case after the first three year of his deal with the red sox david price is teetering on the edge of the red box boston fan had not been very happy with his performance especially his record in the playoff in the first two season with the teamprices redemption but price changed a lot of mind in october going in the playoff and finishing second in the world series mvp voting a lot can be forgiven once you hoist the championship trophybeware the second big contract production of course can fall a well even for the best player these three signed two separate contract of million or more each wa a highperforming player during his first one but each fell into the red box during his secondno matter how well harper and machado perform during the length of their new contract team may want to be careful about offering them another one zack greinke opted out of his dodger contract before million wa paid out we did not include that contract here we included only his deal with the diamondback justin upton and cc sabathia renegotiated their contract we included them only once in these chart contract were not adjusted for inflation if a player did not play for one or more season during the contract we assigned them a war of for those season this includes player who retired before the end of their contract we did not account for any insurance reimbursement the team may have received there are several variation of war we used the version from baseballreferencecomadditional reporting by tyler kepneradvertisement

polo ground in and so were their many fan who know why everyone showed up or why so many of them brought banner but some of the fervor wa just sheer irreverence the antiestablishment joy of rooting for a team that wa so awfuland for sure the mets were terrible again although this time they managed to win game instead of the nuttiest moment came when jimmy piersall ran around the base backward after hitting the th home run of his career the most exhilarating occurred when ten of thousand of mets fan invaded yankee stadium for a charity exhibition game against baseball defending champion had their banner confiscated and then went berserk anyway when the mets actually wona year later the mets moved to shea stadium their new home in queen and took their ineptitude with them they went they lost their home opener while creating a massive traffic jam at the end of may they lost a doubleheader at shea that went on forever because of a inning second game that lasted hour minute a record at the time three week later at shea the mets were the victim of a perfect game thrown by philadelphia jim bunningin the mets were even worse winning just game while also losing casey stengel who retired after breaking his hip without stengel the mets were le entertaining and still stunk they did move up from last place to ninth in but then fell right back into th a year laterstill that season the mets had the rookie of the year in pitcher tom seaver in the lefthander jerry koosman wa just a impressive in his first season the teammate of seaver and koosman now included other emerging player like jerry grote and bud harrelson and cleon jones and it showed in the mets record a mark that still wasnt very good but suggested that maybe something wa changing and something wasthe journey from hopelessness to champion of the world without having to pas through mediocrity might have been the miracle and the devil bargainby robert lipsytemocking the mets wa considered cool in the early day of that ragtag expansion franchise because it concealed our painfully conflicted true feeling at the same time that we were deeply ashamed at having been stuck with such a lousy team how could baseball have scammed u like this we also embraced a lunatic joy at once more feeling major league after all those year being the only threeteam city in the show we hadnt found the yankee enough for usso we celebrated the mets in an appropriately earlys way ironic selfaware rambunctious rockish the crowd with their madefortv bedsheet banner seemed charmingly selfdeprecating we dont want to set the world on fire we just want to finish ninth but they also foreshadowed darker time to come pray the price of allowing then encouraging grandstand populism would eventually be their strident demandsbut those two polo ground year were fun energized medium member were thrilled with their new job and the west coast trip to visit the dodger and giant that came with them writer replated the former yankee manager casey stengel a a madcap guru even a he spoke the truth after yet another loss the attendance wa robbed were still a fraud often with sarcasm come out and see my amazin mets a teenager who would never fulfill his hype ed kranepool wa held up a the face of the futuremost notorious of all an inept first baseman marv throneberry wa extolled a the symbol of the bumbling present year later he told me how miserable he had been a a met he had entered the big league a a yankee mickey mantle heir no le after a sensational minor league career being celebrated a marvelous marv the mets fool broke his spiritperhaps the most telling signal that celebrating the lovable loser a comforting symbol of everyman just like u would be shortlived wa the creation of neggies precursor of the moneyball analytics of today we needed those negative statistic to prove that the mets were not merely profoundly secondrate but actually the worst of all time so gloriously bad that we could claim them a champion inverted champion to be sure of game lost chance bobbled base missed hope dashed for the mets even mediocrity wa a dream deferredbut the founding mets writer and fan couldnt paint over the mids slump in real american life the glow of postworld war ii triumphalism had given way to the bay of pig the murderous resistance to civil right activism mounting cold war anxiety the assassination of jfk there wa too much dread mets fan began to clamor for some win on their scoreboardthere wa a jolt of hope in when the mets moved into their home for the next year shea stadium paid for by the taxpaying fan named for a wheelerdealer lawyer the ballpark wa riddled with imperfection the team wa even worse lurching through five more losing season the mets couldnt even claw their way up to mediocritythe socalled new breed fan named and championed by the swaggering righteous daily news columnist dick young grew restive beyond the ballpark the riot and assassination were taking their toll on the public psyche and the mets our safety valve our comic relief were becoming just another black hole of despairand then came tom seaver fresh ebullient hardworking immensely talented nothing mediocre here he wa the mets first homegrown superstar and many of u still think the only one in he wa national league rookie of the year an allstar and a game winner for a lastplace club the next year he again won game this time for a ninthplace clubbut tom terrific set the world on fire not only the top gun of a strong young pitching staff jerry koosman nolan ryan gary gentry tug mcgraw but

hockey game a shot heard round the world a perfect punch this miracle unspooled through seven year of suffering a preparation for victory punctuated by seavers beating the highly favored oriole wa almost anticlimactic it wa truly about the journey from hopelessness to champion of the world without having to pas through mediocrity maybe that wa the miracle and the devil bargainin fact a case could be made here it come that the world series is still the high point of mets history that nothing in the next year came close the mets lost the series to oakland and won in under morally nullifying circumstance not only did they win because of a red sox error but a member of that team in his final major league season at a still serviceable wa seaverhe should have still been a metin a

stopped by the new york time on friday to answer some question about his big year the business of baseball and the wildfirerelief charity california strong that he helped create with several other major leaguers this interview ha been edited and condensed for claritybaseball player generally dont have renown of football or basketball player why are you doing this postmvp medium tourits important not only for yourself but for the game if youve been blessed to be in a position and put on the field to speak out on these topic a far a california strong or the direction the game is headed obviously you want to bring a much attention to the game a possible and grow baseball a much a you can it important it come with the responsibility that being a league mvp come with im just learning on the fly trying to the best i canis there something culturally different about baseball that discourages player speaking out like they do in the nfl or nba why dont you see that much activism or player inserting themselves into the political or culture conversationi dont think it a conscious effort not to be engaged in that stuff you still see a lot of baseball player doing good at the end of the day when youre trying to do good thats all that matter whether it in a different aspect than in the nba or nfl you should use your platform for goodhow is the california strong campaign going you said youve raised millionit all started wa basically a group text with ryan braun mike moustakas and the son of the brewer owner mike attanasio just basically trying to find information on if everybodys house were ok since everyone had to be evacuated information wa kind of minimal once we found out that everyone wa ok it kind of turned into how can we help we thought we needed to give back because the borderline shooting happened basically a few hour before that night when all the fire started so we thought about doing something to give back to the hometown and help get people back on their feetthe nlcs wa mostly on a cable network fox sport while the afc and nfc title game in the nfl were more widely watched on fox and cbs do you think baseball need more of a national audiencei dont think baseball is ever going to be the fastpaced game that football or basketball is it never going to be constant action thats never how the game is played with player being allowed to express themselves a little bit more freely on the field there also been a bigger push for them to be on social medium to sharing their life and personality it going to attract the younger fan because theyre going to feel like theyre engaged and maybe a little bit more invested in these player because they know them a little better and when there a game like that they tune in and see how their favorite player or team doeswhats life like after winning an mvp it is different and everything changed one afternoon basically there is the show and the announcement and then everything is completely different the next day you just take it in stride and it not anything thats been overwhelming or i cant handle this it not like that by any mean but it definitely been a lot of funhas there been much chatter between you your teammate or other player about the slow freeagent market or how two superstar bryce harper and manny machado remain unsignedwe talk about it i dont want to share exactly what those conversation are theyre two of the best player that we have in the game right now the process hasnt played out player talk id like to leave it at thatthis past season wa the first in which there were more strikeout than hit it an issue with the commissioner office theyd like to see more hit and more action do you see it a a problemi dont know how you solve it but youve definitely seen an increase in velocity year by year there been an emphasis on the whole launch angle thing and pitcher combating that with throwing fastball up in the zone there been a greater push on analytics and team to look into it and how to get guy out hitter have that a well but hitting ha always been hard hitting a baseball is still incredibly hard it just one of those thing where hitter have to make an adjustment and we have to find a way since ive been in the league for part of six year you can tell already the difference a far a just the amount of power arm you face on a nightly and daily basisgiven the oversaturation of statistic and measurement in baseball what do you look at to evaluate your own performancei feel like probably the biggest one is ops it the biggest stat that people take value from in the game from the people who evaluate it and the people who play it just because it slugging and on base two of the thing that make up a productive baseball player weve gotten away from batting average a little bit i still think batting average is important other people will tell you it not anymore in the game but you dont want to make out basically you still have to get on base and be productive somehow getting on base and getting a hit are really not that big of a deal it still really hard to get a hit in the big league whether it a single or homer there still something that can be said for that youve seen that where the game ha gotten away from it where it become acceptable to hit or and hit homersevery hit almost feel like a miracle because pitcher are throwing so hard do you ever sit back and think this is a really freakish skill i havesometimes it feel a lot harder than other time there time when youre in the ondeck circle or on the bench and youre like i have no shot i dont know how im going to do this but ive got to figure it out and other time youre more locked in and it doesnt feel a hard it the same feeling every spring training when the pitcher are throwing their bullpen or live batting practice and youre like oh man this might be the year i go for i dont know how im going to do this and then you get back to the process i feel like from the side or in the dugout this guy is throwing is so hard and then when you get in there it not really what you think it is because youre so used to it it just slows down every day when youre in therein the second half last year did the ball look like a beach ball to youthere are time even during that second half where there were week stretch where it kind of leaf you and doesnt feel right but it come back quicker when you go on stretch like that there still time where it doesnt feel great but it still come back to you quicker some year youre constantly searching for it and it is different for everybodycan you purposefully foul off a pitchi cant i feel like the only guy that probably could purposefully foul off a ball is who do you thinkichirono but he might be one of the guy but i wa going to say joey votto i havent talked to joey about this but i feel like sometimes joey is up there just trying to walk and he just trying to foul the ball off until he walksdo you guess at the platei dont like to guess just react some guy are guess hitter i just could never do it if you guess and guess wrong you have no shot of hitting anything elsewhen you look back on your childhood what do you think wa a difference maker in term of allowing you to become an elite athlete in term of your development the most important thing for kid would basically be have fun and enjoy it travel ball ha become a business and not a much fun for kid these day they think their kid are getting scouted when theyre or year old you should just enjoy the game at this point in your life why is there any pressure to play well when youre or it doesnt matter if you hit five homer or strike out five time in a game the milwaukee brewer are not watching your travel ball game right now and saying johnny is a firstround pick and were taking him this yearadvertisement

red sox who went on to replace them a world series championsgeorge springer the most valuable player of the world series did not watch a moment of boston triumph over the los angeles dodger he wa not despondent though he wa simply taking time for himself after a largely satisfying seasona lot of people think when you lose youre sitting at home all destroyed for a long time but a lot ha to go right to get where we got the previous year springer said this spring at the astros training complex in west palm beach fla we just got beat one of the thing about this game is youve got to be able to accept failure we didnt have a bad year we lost in the alcs you move onmlb season preview stuffed to it seamsthe astros never expected to string together championship general manager jeff luhnow who often make blackjack analogy understands that sometimes the card will not flip his way but the astros keep getting a seat at the table and tipping the odds in their favorthey turned to the freeagent market to find an ideal fit for their lineup michael brantley the former cleveland left fielder who signed a twoyear million deal brantley is a lefty in a rightleaning lineup and a premier contact hitter who accentuates what the astros do besthouston ranked sixth in the major in run last season and only the indian hitter had fewer strikeout brantley had extrabase hit and the secondlowest strikeout percentage in the major trailing only the los angeles angel andrelton simmonsgood thing happen when you put the ball in play said brantley who struck out only time in plate appearance rally can start with an error or a miscommunication on a fly ball you dont know how you look around this locker room not too many guy strike out in this lineup we put the ball in play hard and take our chancesopponents could make up a bit more ground against houston this season the astros pitcher led the major in strikeout but the team subsequently lost charlie morton to free agency and lance mccullers jr to tommy john surgery both averaged at least strikeout per nine inning to fill those spot and the one left by the unsigned free agent dallas keuchel the astros will use collin mchugh wade miley and brad peacock or framber valdez with power arm waiting in the high minorswere a pretty complete team and that sometimes brings question manager aj hinch said i understand why theyre there but they dont necessarily have to be there we have five really good starting pitching candidate and we have some youngster that are coming fast the rotation not keeping me up at nighthinch can rest easy there may be no clear favorite among the power team in this league but the astros look like the safest bet to push through to the world seriesthey have far more depth than their rival in the al west the oakland athletics who won game last season are like the buddy in your fantasy league who load up on some category but ignores others in this case the a have lot of slugger reliever and star

breaking a bone in his right hand on the team trip to japan a rotatorcuff strain to jesus luzardo their top pitching prospect hurt their depth but if the a have a chance they will find a way to make shrewd addition one thing is certain designated hitter khris davis the major home run leader since will bat it ha been his precise average in each of the last four seasonsthe los angeles angel have committed about million to center fielder mike trout through that give them plenty of time to find a way to finally win a playoff game with the game best player on their roster they think it could happen this fallwere going to be a strong offensive club were going to increase our onbase percentage and our home run are going to be there again this year general manager billy eppler said a a lot of club can say health is going to be very very important to u weve been the example of what can happen to a club when you dont have good health if we can get north of start out of our starter were going to be in a really really good positionfor the angel that could be asking too much their starter have a dubious health history and adding matt harvey a a free agent most likely wont alter that trend andrew heaney ha had elbow inflammation in spring training and tyler skaggs dealt with forearm fatigue shohei ohtani will hit this season but his recovery from tommy john surgery will keep him off the moundthe team that truly taunted the pitching god though is the texas ranger all four of their new starter lance lynn shelby miller drew smyly and edinson volquez have had tommy john surgery in the last three and a half yearsnl preview a deep talent pool should keep the dodger afloatit help because we can lean on each other hey do you feel this what do you do between start said smyly who spent the last two season with seattle and the chicago cub yet never threw a pitch for either team but at the same time i think all of u are over talking about it we just want to put it behind u and go play againthe ranger likewise are eager to bury their recent past their loss last season matched their most since their hope for improvement rest on young hitter like joey gallo ronald guzman nomar mazara and rougned odor who strike out too much but could break into stardom a the team prepares to move to a new arlington ballpark with a retractable roof next seasonthe seattle mariner made a noble effort to end baseball longest playoff drought since but they should now replace the ranger in the division cellar they allowed more run than they scored last season but still finished game over recognizing the anomaly general manager jerry dipoto spent the winter dumping robinson cano nelson cruz edwin diaz james paxton jean segura mike zunino and otherssome veteran like jay bruce and edwin encarnacion came back a part of salary swap but dipoto baseball most active general manager could trade them this summer in an effort to build a more stable foundationencarnacion came to seattle in a trade with the cleveland indian who shed of the player who appeared in their threegame division series loss to the astros those player will earn more than million for their new team this season and the indian added few veteran replacement besides carlos santana and carlos gonzalezthe indian wont win the division without major contribution from shortstop francisco lindor who wa slowed this spring by a calf injury and third baseman jose ramirez who hit from last aug through the end of the playoff but their rotation is so dominant that they should still have enough offense to get byonly major leaguers worked inning while recording strikeout last season and four were indian corey kluber trevor bauer carlos carrasco and mike clevinger with those starter and the allstar closer brad hand the indian should win the central for the fourth year in a rowthe minnesota twin under new manager rocco baldelli are the only team that could catch them the twin added the veteran nelson cruz marwin gonzalez cj cron and jonathan schoop to their lineup and a progressive new pitching coach wes johnson who came from the university of arkansas should help them get more from their staffto win though the twin need more from their talented but erratic young core jose berrios byron buxton max kepler jorge polanco eddie rosario and miguel sano all should be in their prime and the twin would like to stop guessing how good they can beyou can dream a lot on the potential upside of that group and you see spurt of it said derek falvey the twin president for baseball operation the key in my mind is how do you get all those guy firing together at the same time because if you do thats a really talented crew and we havent quite seen the potential of that entire group all working at the same timeeven if they can not catch cleveland the twin could claim a wild card by feasting on the weak in the division the bottom three team each lost at least game last season and none have done much to improvewhile the chicago white sox flirted with bryce harper and manny machado in free agency they still have never given a freeagent contract richer than million they are deep in prospect but some of the most promising one from last spring infielder yoan moncada and starter lucas giolito were major disappointment in the summer eloy jimenez an electrifying rookie outfielder who signed a sixyear

three of the major leaguers with more than stolen base last year this will be a painstaking rebuilding process but the last one resulted in two pennant and the world series titlethe detroit tiger owe miguel cabrera million for the next five season a staggering figure for a player who turn in april and missed most of last season with a ruptured biceps tendon he a future hall of famer and a renaissance season home run would give cabrera for his career but there not much else to draw interestthe tiger former architect dave dombrowski is now the president for baseball operation for the boston red sox and in he earned the championship he could never quite get in detroit it fair to expect the red sox to repeat in the east but no team ha successfully defended a world series title since the yankeestheres a lot of reason behind that but first and foremost it tough to win period dombrowski said you get a lot of break when you win even having a good club you need a break here or there sometimes you just dont get a manythe red sox lost no significant player from the major best offense and resigned the postseason star nathan eovaldi to keep their rotation intact starter chris sale david price rick porcello eovaldi and eduardo rodriguez can not double a reliever in the regular season a they did last october but the offense and rotation should make up for an imperfect bullpenon a nightly basis the guy on the mound is going to go give u a chance to win the game manager alex cora said they go six or seven and we know offensively who we are it a good feelingunless the yankee reach the world series this year the s will be their first decade since the s without at least one al pennant their last wa in when they won their th titleit ha flown by man but it been way too long said outfielder brett gardner the longesttenured yankee from the front office to the ownership they go out of their way to put the best possible team on the field every year and it been a disappointing yearsthe yankee very well could reach the world series but they might have to start by hosting the wild card game for the third year in a row the volume of injury this spring dellin betances didi gregorius aaron hick cc sabathia luis severino could be easier to handle because of a forgiving early schedule the yankee play of their first game against baltimore the white sox detroit

backandforth pennant race with boston all summercan the tampa bay ray elbow into the chase they won game last season partly by defying conventional pitching role with their opener strategy an innovation that sprang from a logical premisethe whole goal is how can we maximize the talent of our player and how can we put them in a position to succeed and put u in a position to win a much a possible said chaim bloom the ray senior vice president for baseball operation our group in the clubhouse ha really high expectation and so do wethe ray plan to use two opener every five day they could follow the opener with a socalled bulk guy one pitcher who work the bulk of the middle inning or a parade of reliever but they need their traditional starter charlie morton tyler glasnow and the cy young award winner blake snell to producereliable starter are the key to letting u do the opener manager kevin cash said not to put added pressure on them but if we get good starting pitching we can be a little bit more aggressive on the other day and mix and match a little bit morefans of the toronto blue jay will start the season pining for third baseman vladimir guerrero jr and shortstop bo bichette whose father combined to play nearly game in the major guerrero and bichette dante son have played none but both are top prospect on baseball america listguerrero wa overweight at the start of spring training and then strained an oblique muscle bichette wa hitting in exhibition game when he wa sent to minor league camp when the new manager charlie montoyo can write both name on a lineup card in toronto this rebuild will acceleratethe baltimore oriole also have a new manager brandon hyde and a new general manager mike elia hyde came from the chicago cub and elia from the astros so both have seen the payoff from patient roster makeover theyll need a lot of patience in baltimore where the oriole just endured a franchiserecord loss elia understands the magnitude of the taskits a challenge im looking forward to but we do have titan in our division year in and year out elia said weve got two really good farm system and front office in toronto and tampa bay a well so all four

yearold luis severino the staff ace on the mound and gary sanchez crouched behind the plate the heart of the lineup will include judge already one of baseball most recognizable star after only two full seasonswere going to be set for quite a few year to be doing a lot of good thing in new york judge said at the yankee spring training base hereafter year of being carried by older player or building rapidly through free agency the yankee now have their best core of young player since the day of derek jeter jorge posada mariano rivera andy pettitte and bernie williams coming up through the team systemand while judge is understandably optimistic about his team odds of competing for a world series title it is already fair to wonder how long this core group of player will remain together and at what costthe yankee decision maker of course have already been weighing these question the biggest hint the yankee are already thinking ahead came this month the fouryear million extension which could extend to five year given to severino and they have approached other key player like outfielder aaron hick and relief pitcher dellin betances about possible extension which will weigh much heavier on the yankee payroll than their current dealstheres going to be payday coming down and we have to prepare for those said brian cashman the yankee longtime general managerthe yankee did not seriously pursue the star free agent manny machado for many reason his asking price he signed for year and million with the san diego padre a desire to spend money in several area of the roster instead of just a few and the fact that they already posse a talented third baseman andujar and a huge contract most of giancarlo stanton year million dealbut one factor wa the financial future of their own young standouts to borrow cashmans phrasing every dollar affect somebody el dollareverything is connected he said our payroll continue to increase and were preparing and have been preparing for that a these player that we think are very special continue their journeysit might seem unusual for the yankee who are valued by forbes at billion and had a tradition of chasing the best free agent regardless of price under the former owner george steinbrenner to be concerned about the future salary of their player but since steinbrenners heyday baseball ha implemented rule that limit spending in the amateur draft or the international market and a luxury tax that team generally treat a a hard capthat is not to say the yankee couldnt afford to pursue highpriced free agent and retain their young star but jim duquette a former mets general manager said the highest luxury tax penalty could be a legitimate deterrent even for team a wealthy a the yankee the red sox paid million in penalty for their million payroll in and will be penalized in the draft but it helped them win last year world seriesto be able to handle the luxury tax penalty in these large market you have to grow your own player duquette said and if youre competitive youre picking at the low end of the draft and it hard to hit on the aaron judge of the world down at the s in the first round where they drafted himso when you have a core like the yankee this strategy make sense they absolutely could afford to pay the tax but the penalty is what make it somewhat prohibitivelast year wa the first time since the luxury tax wa put in place in that the yankee avoided penalty having dropped under the million threshold after being first or second in endofyear payroll ranking for decade the yankee had a million payroll that ranked sixth in baseball according to cot baseball contract the yankee estimated payroll for luxury tax purpose this season is million over the first tax threshold of million according to rosterresourcecom but some relief is on the horizon with hefty contract like jacoby ellsburys coming off the book in two year and cc sabathia retiring after this seasonbut big payouts also loom judge and sanchez among others will see big jump in pay in when they become eligible for salary arbitration hence the yankee stated desire to consider multiyear deal for their arbitrationeligible player or pending freeagent playersfree agency is tough duquette said it hit or miss if you like your player and know they fit in the organization and play well in new york then why not try to keep them togetherin a labor market that seems increasingly tilted toward the club player no longer see free agency a the hallowed ground they once dreamed about since drug testing began team are increasingly wary of player production after age and one effect ha been an increasing number of player signing deal considered teamfriendly before reaching free agencythe yankee have broached extension talk with betances and hick both of whom are set to become free agent after this season both declined to elaborate on the level of the discussion but said they would be interested in remaining with the yankeesits an amazing place with a great future and of course it something id like to be a part of hick saidboth are intriguing case hick ha blossomed in new york after being acquired in a trade putting together the best season of his career the past two year he had a careerhigh home run and run batted in despite only playing game last season but he ha dealt with several injury and will be a free agent at drafted and developed by the yankee betances ha been one of the best and most durable reliever in baseball since he ha a era better than all but four relief pitcher what may work against betances is his age he will be during the season and his workload his surgically repaired arm ha thrown a lotnowadays middle reliever are getting a lot of love betances said this offseason alone setup men such a jeurys familia and joe kelly a well a betances teammate adam ottavino and zack britton all scored contract of at least millionanother pending free agent the yankee like shortstop didi gregorius who ha also improved since his trade to new york in to go along with stout defense gregorius ha hit and averaged home run over the past three year but he will be next season and his recovery from tommy john surgery will most likely cut his season in halfjudge and sanchez will make at least the league minimum of this season the yankee may wait until next winter to begin longterm contract talk with the two a they did with severinoim focused on the season and i havent heard anything judge said last week when asked if the yankee had approached about his contract futurecoming off a rough season sanchez would seem unlikely to entertain longterm offer now but will judge feel some impulse to cash in on his earning power relatively soon given that he will not be a free agent until before his age season in or will he wait to see how the market change when the current collective bargaining agreement which ha increasingly drawn the ire of player expires in december in severinos case if the yankee pick up his million option for he will be a free agent entering his age season for the time being severino seems perfectly happy with having secured a new dealit give me a lot of confidence he said every time i got to the gym ill be smiling it a lot security for my familyadvertisement

dome but dont say they are playing on foreign soilthats because ton of clay silt and sand mixture were shipped by boat from the united state to make the batter box pitcher mound base pit and bullpen feel like home the dirt swap wa news to the veteran seattle pitcher mike leake who nonetheless gave his stamp of approval after starting the first of two exhibition game each club played against team from japan nippon professional baseball a a tuneupoh you mean we werent pitching on the same mound the japanese team use during their season leake said sunday it felt like the same mound that we pitch on in the state the only thing i would say is that maybe they put a little too much water at first so some of the clay stuck to my spike in the first inning but that happens at home too after that it wa perfectfor murray cook and his traveling crew of three that is the highest praise cook ha been a consultant for mlb on field construction and maintenance for nearly three decade and he serf a the unofficial head groundskeeper for any leaguesanctioned event played on a diamond not ordinarily manicured by one of it teamsthe commissioner office and player association have a big plan to develop the game worldwide and with that they need field said cook who is also the president of the commercial landscaper brightviews sport turf division in pennsylvania so i get tasked with these fun project from them to create these canvas for the player to go out and performhe wa quite familiar with the stadium for wednesday game the fifth time mlb had opened a season at the tokyo dome the most of any ballpark outside it member stadium in north america a packed crowd of came out to see what is likely to be ichiro suzukis final pro appearance in japan the fan were treated to an offensive showcase won by the mariner it wa a different story in when the chicago cub and the mets split a pair of game here in the first regularseason game outside north americaaside from thrilling play like benny agbayanis extrainning pinchhit grand slam for the mets that series included embarrassing moment that baseball would prefer not to repeat robin ventura twice slipped in a batter box that wa made of the softer dirt used in japanese baseballplayers described it a similar to the loose soil used with potted plant and it caused more headache when an allstar team came over for a postseason tour in roger clemens foot wa sore and dontrelle willis developed pain in his back cook said because they were sliding more than usual on the pitcher moundcook wa camping with his family in the blue ridge mountain when the league summoned him to japan in an emergencythey were all complaining about how soft the mound were cook recalled i said well we can fix that i came over and whipped up a concoction that got them through the rest of that tournamentsince then the league ha taken greater step to ensure that leakes experience is the norm cook estimated he had been to tokyo four time since the game were announced last spring in between he spent time in london mexico new zealand the dominican republic and peru among other place to work on field for game clinic and other event over the past year his challenge is to ensure that wherever the game is taking place the field is always up to mlbs competitive and safety standardsthere are plenty of other issue to address besides the dirt for this series cook work began on march and included helping lay a new previously planned artificial turf surface at the arena the base used in japan are also fluffier and rise to a crown while american base are harder and flatter they also anchor into the base pit differently so cook not only ha to bring base from home but also ha to change the hole into which they are fittedjapan also us permanent nylon marker four around each batter box and four around the catcher box a guide for laying chalk line around those space in the united state a metal template is brought out before each game for the marking in past event here mlb catcher complained that the halfinchhigh tuft were distracting and they would pull them out of the ground and toss them away cook now store one of his metal template at the tokyo dome along with an array of other handy suppliescooks job may be easier in japan than it is almost anywhere else because of baseball deep history here the ton of dirt for this series is a smaller shipment than previous one because he ha been able to find suitable domestic material to complement his imported soilbut when the yankee and the red sox play a series at london stadium in june mlbs first regularseason game in europe cook will need to export ton of dirt to england to build a field entirely from scratchwith his vast experience cook will be up to the task but he noted that there wa one item in his fieldconversion process that still bedevils himwhile he ha become an expert in the nuance of importing american soil product through custom in many country he estimated that japanese security agent had confiscated seven metal tape measure from him over the year this week he vowed he would remember to tuck it into his checked luggage after the mariner and the a are

advertisementsupported by national league previewlos angeles ha a strong chance to become the first team since the yankee to lose two world series in a row and return for a third tryby tyler kepnerthe final out of the last world series exemplified the los angeles dodger resourcefulness and torment the year before they had lost the world series to the houston astros when their star shortstop corey seager grounded out to end game last fall long after seager had been lost for the season to injury his replacement manny machado struck out to clinch the title for the boston red soxthe dodger simply excel at talent acquisition loading their roster with more solid player and the occasional superstar than any other team in the major yet theyve suffered the indignity of losing the last two world series on their home fieldthose defeat may obscure just how good the dodger really are they have a strong chance to become the first team since the yankee to lose two world series in a row and return for a third try last year wa probably the most talented team ive ever been around but it didnt necessarily perform like that on a nightly basis said andrew friedman the dodger president for baseball operation we led the nl in run scored we led the nl in fewest run allowed but it wa just kind of the choppiness of it for u a lot of it is how to be a consistent a we can be bring our talent to the forefront a many night a we possibly canmlb season preview stuffed to it seamstalent wa everywhere on the roster last season and this one should be no different by baseball prospectus calculation the dodger had player with at least two win above replacement for them last season no other team had more than such player and the average team had seventhat depth allows manager dave robert to aggressively exploit matchup advantage on offense and to use his starting pitcher with extreme caution the dodger are the only team that ha not used a pitcher for inning in any of the last three seasonsthey will be tempted this season to unleash walker buehler who sparkled last fall in a onegame playoff with colorado for the national league west title in game of the national league championship series clincher in milwaukee and in the dodger only victory in the world series when he shut out the red sox for seven inningsbuehler is not the only young homegrown starter who could make a major impact this season the lefthander julio uria showed in october that he wa past the shoulder trouble that cost him nearly two seasonstheres really no pitch limit for walker but were going to see how his body reacting how he feel and have that open line of communication robert said with julio it been abbreviated for him the last couple of year so to say he ha a clear runway i dont think is fair to him but i do know that he going to impact u this yearbuehler and the veteran clayton kershaw have taken it slowly in spring training but with the dodger it is hard to tell the difference between hurt and injured they play the long game in los angeles where arriving at full strength in october is all that mattersthe dodger lost a few contributor from last year team but added center fielder aj pollock who wa a force for arizona when healthy reliever joe kelly whom they plan to use in an expanded setup role that could stretch him to inning and the grizzled catcher russell martin who had a onbase percentage for toronto last year martin batting average did not bother the dodger friedman said because he consistently made hard contactmartin ha played in five league championship series without ever advancing to the world series this could be the year he get there and with any luck he just might leap into the arm of closer kenley jansen after the final outthen again the colorado rockies are conceding nothing in pursuit of their first division title they signed daniel murphy to play first base and gave third baseman nolan arenado an eightyear million contract extension last month the entire team surprised arenado by attending the news conference announcing the deali love playing with this group said arenado who fought back tear for a moment i really believe we can win i wouldnt make this decision if i didnt believe thatthe rockies pitching carried them last season setting club record for most strikeout lowest whip walksplushits per inning pitched and fewest hit allowed in a nonstrike season kyle freeland and german marquez were rotation stalwart and scott oberg and wade davis who allowed one run in the regular season after aug stabilized a bullpen that will count on a full season from seunghwan oh to offset the loss of adam ottavino to the yankeeswhile colorado kept it cornerstone the arizona diamondback shed theirs trading first baseman paul goldschmidt to st louis they have not done much to replace the production of goldschmidt and pollock but with zack greinke robbie ray zack godley and luke weaver in the rotation they expect to competewere trying to make a shift here manager torey lovullo said were going to rely on the pitching and defense and were going to make up for some offensive loss in other waysreverseengineer the diamondback and youd get the san diego padre who added a middleoftheorder slugger with infielder manny machado but have a painfully inexperienced rotation led by joey lucchesithe padre will soon let loose a flood of prospect so it is hard to predict how close they really are to contending but starter chris paddack and shortstop fernando tati jr offered tantalizing spring training glimpse of the kind of young cheap talent that enabled the padre to afford a year million contract for machadoal preview how hard will it be for the red sox to repeat ask the astrosyou need to have quality young player that are making majorleague minimum or prearbitration salary to enable you to go out and sign some biggerdollar player especially in our market where it not unlimited fund general manager aj preller said we feel that weve built up the talent base to enable u to get into conversation for machado and some of the bigname free agentsspeaking of machado preller added you see it in the energy here at the complex it raise the level of competition for everybodywill it raise the padre place in the standing they should at least move past the san francisco giant who did not improve an offense that ranked th of team in run last season ahead of only miami this will be the final season for giant manager bruce bochy who is victory shy of in his career he will need a lot of luck to get thereevery nl central team expects to contend which make this the most intriguing division in the major the milwaukee brewer won it last season in a onegame playoff over the chicago cub before their joy ride ended in that game loss to the dodger in the nlcs they know they might have missed their best chance to bring the world series to miller parkits so difficult to put yourself in that position ever again outfielder ryan braun said we could have a much better team a much better regular season but thing have to go right to get to a place where you have a game to get to the world series at home with the pitcher we want on the mound after we had just won game and felt great about our chance im grateful for the opportunity but it not an easy thing to get overthe brewer hope to get over it by finding an ace or two from a group of rookie who pitched mostly in relief in october corbin burnes freddy peralta and brandon woodruff they will again lean heavily on a strong bullpen and slugging lineup that includes the most valuable player award winner christian yelich and a new catcher yasmani grandal who hit home run with an onbase plus slugging percentage for the dodger last seasonthe dodger benched grandal for most of the postseason after he struggled on defense in game of the nlcs in milwaukee that diminished grandals value but gave the brewer an opportunity a oneyear million contract that could be a steallook guy go into defensive slump general manager david stearns said we focused on the entirety of what we think he can contribute to our team and we think it meaningful he a very good receiver he a good framer he handle a pitching staff well and he can control the running gamethe st louis cardinal went last season for manager mike shildt who replaced the fired mike matheny in midjuly it wasnt quite enough to lift them to the playoff but they should return this year after a threeyear absence an interminable gap for their regal brandits a long time i know said john mozeliak the president for baseball operation were very aware of itin goldschmidt marcell ozuna and matt carpenter the cardinal have three elite run producer to go with slick defender like center fielder harrison bader second baseman kolten wong and catcher yadier molina who is and just won his ninth gold glove jack flaherty could be a breakout rotation star and jordan hick who threw pitch last season that hit mile per hour or higher will form an imposing relief duo with the newcomer andrew millerthe chicago cub finally solved miller in game of the world series in cleveland when they completed a comeback and won their first championship since they have not returned to the world series and last season wildcard flameout put the clubhouse on notice theo epstein the president for baseball operation ha vowed sweeping change if he doe not see improvementmanager joe maddon is working in the final year of his contract surrounded by new coach but a roster that still includes more than half of the player who appeared for the cub in the world series the core deserves one more chance and another title would be no surprise but given the strength of the division neither would third placethe cincinnati red are the only team in the major with at least loss in each of the last four season that streak should end now because the red can finally pair their solid offense with a respectable rotation luis castillo anthony desclafani sonny gray tanner roark and alex wood if they were in the al central the red might be the favorite the nl version is much differentill tell you right now this is the best division in baseball said red reliever jared hughes who ha also played for pittsburgh and milwaukee were always incredibly competitive from top to bottom the goal is to win the division to win the world series and the vibe coming in is that were capable of doing that but there no complacency in the nl centralthe pittsburgh pirate can also dream big because of five exceptional pitcher starter jameson taillon chris archer and trevor williams and reliever felipe vazquez and keone kela but their middling offense got few upgrade and right fielder gregory polanco will spend at least the first month recovering from shoulder surgeryacross pennsylvania the philadelphia phillies were the clear winner of the offseason a meaningless title of course but reason enough to consider them the east favorite despite going last september to spoil a promising seasonwe had a lot of hole to fill that wa the conclusion said john middleton the phillies managing partner when you look at the rubble of the last six week of the season we werent a player away from being a good team we were a bunch of player awaygeneral manager matt klentak started by acquiring shortstop jean segura from seattle a part of a deal for carlos santana a masterstroke that allowed rhys hoskins to move back to first base from left field where andrew mccutchen now play after signing a a free agent klentak also signed reliever david robertson and traded for the game best catcher jt realmutoit wa a good winter and then the phillies signed bryce harper the former national star for year and millionto have him in this clubhouse is deflating for the team in our division so it a great feeling to be on this side starter jake arrieta said not that the team in our division are scared by any mean i dont think thats the case but we definitely appreciate the organization signing a guy like harper and bringing in the piece we havethe washington national should still reach the playoff with patrick corbin joining max scherzer and stephen strasburg in an overpowering rotation their three best hitter anthony rendon juan soto and trea turner have somehow never made an allstar team but that should change this summerthe reigning division champion the prospectrich atlanta brave added third baseman josh donaldson and catcher brian mccann but otherwise stood pat that may prove to be wise in time but for now it leaf them looking vulnerable a pitcher mike foltynewicz aj minter and mike soroka start the season on the injured listinjuries also struck early for the mets who tried to build a deeper roster this winter but will open without infielder jed lowrie knee and todd frazier oblique frazier is lowrie is and second baseman robinson cano is but the under hitter look good and with jacob degrom atop the rotation and edwin diaz a the closer the mets have a chancei truly believe that we can and will win said brodie van wagenen the new general manager he ha to say that of course and his move have been encouraging but probably not enough given the persistent injury risk on the roster to change the mets spot in the standingsthe miami marlin will be picked for last place in every reasonable forecast the chief executive derek jeter got his wish and had the team mechanical home run sculpture moved to the outside of marlin park the display wa whimsical and fun but it would not have been used much anyway no player on this threadbare roster hit more than homer last seasontyler kepner ha been national baseball writer since he joined the time

team have become more leery about handing out lengthy contract to older player leaving younger one like judge feeling squeezed on each endyou cant play both side said the yankee slugger giancarlo

million to the yankee according to block six analytics a firm based in chicago block six devised a metric called revenue above replacement which attempt to calculate a player value to a team based on factor like merchandise sale attendance social medium influence and television ratingsby block six estimate judge will still be worth at least million a year in his early s despite natural decline in his onfield performancestars are still star adam grossman the founder and chief executive of block six analytics saidbut judge who received a million signing bonus a a firstround pick did not reach the major league until age having spent three year playing college baseball and part of three in the minor league he will not become a free agent until his age season and team might not be willing to hand out a machado or harperlevel contract at that agehis teammate though feel he deserves that type of paycheck nowwhat people need to realize say were taking judge for example he one of the best if not the best at what he doe yankee starting pitcher james paxton said if you look at the best in the world at what they do what are they compensated a lotnext season judge is likely to become a multimillionaire through arbitration that route offer little longterm security a each deal last just one season given that and the uncertain nature of free agency the sport ha gone through a small explosion in contract extension this spring the yankee could offer judge a huge extension during arbitration a they did with luis severino last month but such a deal would most likely not come close to what machado and harper earned by virtue of reaching free agency at an abnormally young agethe player union ha argued that team have wielded analytics to justify paying free agent le money ignoring quality like leadership and experiencethe suggestion that all player at a particular age are falling off a cliff is an excuse being used to drive down player salary tony clark the executive director of the mlb player association saidmlb ha labeled it a distribution problem dan halem the deputy commissioner said the player portion of revenue had been relatively consistent over the past decade arbitration salary had risen and the topearning free agent were taking away from the restits pretty easy to say let pay the younger player more and let continue to pay the free agent what theyre getting paid halem said that system doesnt work for u because the overall amount going to player hasnt changed it just being distributed among free agent differentlytheres salary inequity among player in that the superstar are getting more and more and other free agent who are not valued the same way by club are getting lessmlb and the player association said they were open to discussing the compensation structure in negotiation expected to begin sometime after opening day some player have suggested starting arbitration or free agency sooner in player careersclark said the union would consider all option to properly compensate player of all experience level halem said mlb would listen a long a the cumulative spending on player remained at the historical normin the meantime judge remains an exceedingly valuable superstar making vastly le than he is worth to his team he said the yankee had not broached the subject of a potential extension with him yet cashman said it wa premature to comment about judge future with the yankee beyond his remaining four year of team controlwere excited by who he is what he done and what we think he going to continue to do cashman saidin

dispersal beganall concerned were fully and joyfully aware of what the victory meant the chicago cub who had led the division and the mets by game in midaugust had won their afternoon game precluding the possibility that the mets would clinch before taking the fieldbut to perform the clincher at home before the fan who have been such an integral part of the club peculiar history the mets had to win this game the last scheduled for shea stadium three game remain to be played in philadelphia this weekend and two in chicago next weekthe style with which the mets won wa not restricted to the sudden staggering attack with which they greeted steve carlton the cardinal lefthander who had set a major league record by striking out mets only day ago in st louisthe mets had won that game despite the strikeout but last friday they lost a doubleheader to pittsburgh and on saturday were held hitless by bob moose of the pirate if the cub trailing by four game at that point had a chance for a final counterattack that wa itinstead the mets beat pittsburgh twice on sunday and last night completed a threegame sweep of the cardinal the national league champion for the last two yearsthis fivegame winning streak gave them a record of victory in game since aug and in their last game this constituted a stretch drive equal in quality to any produced by baseball most famous champion of the pastthis time carlton struck out only one man cleon jones and it wa the only man he retired gentry who had also started against carlton in the game in st louis quickly retired the cardinal in order in the first and the crowd started chanting and clapping a the first met bud harrelson went to batharrelson looped a single to right field and the cheer increased tommie agee walked and the noise increased again it merged into a standing ovation for jones who wa starting a game for the first time since sept after sitting out most of the month because of hand and rib injury jones who still lead the league in hitting wa determined to be part of this occasion and the fan recognized his desire and his seasonlong contributionbut jones struck out delaying poetic justice only momentarily the very next pitch wa drilled by clendenon over the centerfield wall foot from home platethis home run wa clendenons th of the season his th a a met and it put gentry in control of the gamethe mets werent through however ron swoboda whose two tworun homer had beaten carlton in the game in st louis walked and charles who is and near the end of his career drove his third home run of the year over the foot sign just to the right of dead center a blow he said later he would always rememberdave giusti replaced carlton at that point and although jerry grote greeted him with a double there wa little offensive activity the rest of this brisk gamegentry after three perfect inning yielded a single to lou brock in the fourth and one to mike shannon in the fifth meanwhile the mets started making sensational fielding play by harrelson at short by al wei at second by agee near the fence in leftcentereventually everyone wa just waiting for the formal endingwhen the ninth inning began the crowd began cheering every pitch but brock beat out a single after harrelson made a fine stop behind second and vic davalillo bounced a single out of harrelsons reach to center still the crowd roared encouragement to gentryvada pinson struck out bringing up joe torre the brooklynite who established his slugging reputation with the brave and who might have brought the mets the pennant if they had

game in the third inning with two men on and while ryan wa warming up carty visited the dugout i asked the guy what he threw carty said later some said fastball some said sliderthere wa a reason carty had never seen the young righthander with no on his back ryan never pitched against the brave this season because of military duty and injury and last year carty wa in a hospital recovering from tuberculosis so he stepped up to home plate for his first look at ryanthe next thing carty knew ryan had busted a fastball past him the talk about ryans slider wa merely a rumorryan finished the game and won the pennant for the mets afterward the brave sat in the clubhouse and talked about fastball not slidersheck we knew what he threw said henry aaron who had a homer and double off gentry but two

stockholder in the new york giant and had even tried to block their move to san francisco that didnt work but then along came the mets a team whose game she would sometimes follow at the track with a transistor radio stuck to her ear despite all her money she wa said the writer frank sullivan a simple generous woman with no swank and all her considerable patience wa ultimately rewarded with a championshipthe mets had begun their existence with a lot of player who were near the end of their career so it wa hardly surprising that snider a brooklyn hero who had gone to los angeles with the rest of the dodger wa back in a a met in brooklyn he had been a graceful center fielder famous for sharing that position in new york with willie may and mickey mantle in at age he usually played right field or left and a a met he hit homer batted and then went to san francisco for the season where he ended his career amid a lot le losingthe original bedsheet banner that popped up at the polo ground in and essentially came out of nowhere there wa no internet to organize the effort no publicity campaign by the mets to get thing going instead there were just banner some of them pretty clever but soon enough the mets tried to put a more respectable gloss on the phenomenon by creating an annual banner day and for year at shea stadium it proved to be a popular event even if the banner tended to be a little more cute see above and a little le irreverent than the original a a yankee he won championship and three most valuable player award before retiring in a year later the yankee fired him after just one season a their manager and by the following may berra about to turn wa back in uniform for the mets but a a catcher and pinchhitter the berra experiment did not last long four game including two behind the plate nine atbats two single at that point berra proclaimed himself an old man and retired again but would bring him his th championship a the mets firstbase coachhe wa a fixture at first base for the brooklyn dodger in the s and the ball landed in his glove for the last out of the world series the only time those dodger won it all he finished his playing career with the mets in and and by he wa managing them his powerful physical presence allowing him to convey a quiet unbreakable authority george vecsey a longtime sport columnist for the new york time said he came to think of hodges a one of the most decent straight strongminded manager i ever met it wa a strength that made you listen said tom seaver and it would propel the mets in at charles wa the elder statesman of the mets a team with many key player in their mids the team parttime third baseman and sometime poet charles grew up in the segregated south of the s and s and a a teenager he drew inspiration from spotting jackie robinson in spring training he once even ran after a train on which robinson wa riding with his dodger teammate charles hit only in but he started the winning rally in game of the world series and at the mets victory parade he read a poem he had written while stuck in the minor leagueshe joined the mets in june in a trade with the montreal expo and represented the only significant pickup the mets would make during the season he turned a month later making him the secondoldest player on the team like charles a fellow africanamerican he became a veteran leader on a team that wa mostly white tall and powerful clendenon became part of the four platoon that manager gil hodges used daily he played first base against lefthanded pitcher ed kranepool played against righties and it wa clendenon who later earned a law degree who became a huge factor in the world serieshe wa born in played for the same negro league team that jackie robinson did and in became the first africanamerican player on the chicago cub in the year that followed bank became one of the best and most popular player in the game first a the cub powerhitting shortstop and later a the team first baseman he also became known a mr cub the optimist who endured one losing season after another and still hoped for better and seemed to be that season the one that would get him to his first world series it didnt happenin durocher wa the colorful controversial manager of the brooklyn dodger and gil hodges wa his rookie first baseman but by july of that year durocher had left brooklyn to become the manager of the giant after that it wa in the caldron of dodger v giant that hodges and durocher sized each other up in they were squaring off again durocher managing the cub hodges running the mets durocher still fiery and quotable hodges just the opposite but hodges got the last word when the mets beat out the cubsand what were the yankee up to in what were they up to while the mets pulled off one of the great reversal of all time the answer is nothing much the yankee went continuing a decline that came out of nowhere in the manager wa ralph houk in his second stint in that role in his first he had led the yankee to world series title in and but in the yankee werent winning the best player on the team wa mel stottlemyre who went notable teammate included gene michael joe

in the thor a gaspar put it typical metsask ron swoboda the same question and he graciously overlook his famous catch in the world series and instead cite a september game against the chicago cub with first place on the linein the bottom of the first inning the cub knocked down the mets invaluable leadoff hitter tommie agee swoboda take it from therein the top of the second jerry koosman throw a rocket right at ron santos coconut and he put an arm up you want to play this game i dont think so he hit santo in the arm koosman wa a warrior he wa an assassin they threw at agee thats all koosman neededafter they knocked down agee i remember tom seaver yelling in the dugout you dont want to do that koosman took care of the restask koosman who or what stand out most year later and he is quick to cite gil hodges the manager behind the mets miraclegil wa the man there wa a lot of quiet management that went on he said gil talked a little bit in code but you knew what he meant you knew where he stood and what he expected of you and it worked great we won didnt we at to odds in vega before the season and we end up winninged kranepool who played season for the mets remembers what it wa like to be a platoon player in the world series in the five game it took for the mets to upend the favored baltimore oriole kranepool and three other lefthanded hitter art shamsky ken boswell and wayne garrett were in the starting lineup just once for game did the lefthander want to play in the world series he said yeah but you had to respect gil and what he wa doing we did get to face jim palmer in game and we knocked him out the next day we sat down again so we sat there but we were winningjim mcandrew who wa in the back end of the starting rotation wa on the postseason roster and didnt get to play a single moment but he almost didi wa scared to death because seaver gave up that leadoff homer in the first inning of the world series and hodges immediately had me up in the bullpen he said still he didnt get into that game or any other in the seriesbut you cant gripe he saidmcandrew gaspar swoboda koosman and kranepool spoke to the new york time early this month in connection with the th anniversary of one of the most remarkable moment in baseball history the sudden ascent of the mets to a championship after the team previous life a a laughingstockthe five spoke with pride of what they accomplished but with some sadness too fifty year is a long time and a halfdozen player from that team have died others have serious medical issuesit is a somber scorecard that also includes hodges who died of a heart attack before the season and the death of three of his four coach and seaver the best player on that team ha advancing dementiathe disclosure of seavers condition wa made shortly after the former mets had spoken with the time but they were all aware that seaver had been struggling with the effect of lyme disease for year more than anything they were aware of how relentless time iscasey wa right when he said you get old very quick said kranepool referring to casey stengel who wa the mets manager when kranepool joined the team a a teenager now kranepool is and in need of a kidney transplant although he remains intent on being part of the reunion the mets will stage at citi field in juneits frustrating he said you would like to see everybody but it doesnt work that way i dont think im going to be around for the th so im glad were doing thisswoboda who is also said i dont know where the year went but we are a band of brother very few of u were involved in anything else of that magnitudeits no fun seeing our guy go down said gaspar who is i hope we can have of u at the reunionkoosman said he planned to be there he is the oldest of the five but still doing backandforth bantering with swoboda except now it via email instead of in the clubhouse and what do they jab each other aboutpolitics said koosman swoboda he said is too liberal tell him to get a life he said joking tell him to quit watching msnbc and reading the new york time tell him to read the sport section and stop theretold what koosman had said about him swoboda laughed i love the guy he said but he sends me all this stuff from the blogospheremcandrew amused by all of this wa willing to volunteer that he view himself a socially compassionate fiscally responsible swoboda he added is a nonbackingoff leftya lefty who in played right field and not always that well hodges would take him out of game for defensive purpose and insert gaspar which drove me crazy swoboda saidi wanted to be good enough for hodges not to have to do that he added and eventually i wa eventually he left me aloneright through the top of the ninth inning of game of the series when swobodas doordie catch of brook robinson line drive kept the oriole from taking control of the gameclendenon swoboda noted sardonically called it the stupidest catch he ever saw because i went for itclendenon alert tough collegeeducated a veteran voice in the clubhouse and a central figure in that wild august game in san francisco that gaspar so vividly remembers here how he tell itits the bottom of the ninth tie score one out bob burda is on first willie mccovey is up and we have the mccovey shift on everyone is pulled over to the right im playing left but im almost in center tug mcgraw is pitching and mccovey stick out his bat and hit a high nineiron shot down the leftfield line i chase after the ball pick it up and throw blindly toward home platei knew it wa the game right there i figured burda wa going to score easy but you know what i threw a rocket to jerry grote all the way in the air and burda wa out by foot and grote wa so stunned he rolled the ball back to the mound even though there only two out and mccovey who had reached second see this and take off for third and clendenon who wa always paying attention pick the ball up and throw to third double playthe next inning clendenon hit a home run and we win the gamemcandrew said clendenon could strap you on his back and get those big hit to drive in run for a week or day all the lowscoring game we won themand all the crazy game the mets won them too some mystical combination of talent toughness luck and magic conquered everything in it path for one seasonthe next year swoboda said we tried to make it happen rather than let it happen something wa missing all it doe it add more mystery to in my booka magical mystical mystery actually one that year later still enduresadvertisement

hodges the manager and tom seaver the pitcher later known a the franchise both could turn downright taut eye narrowing jaw tightening speech clipped when reporter or broadcaster or fan or even mets ballplayer acted a if these were the same old metswe reporter were the worst i know i wa conditioned to believe that the mets were fun but terminally haplesswipe that smile off your face mister this is no laughing matterhodges had seen combat on okinawa while seaver wa a marine reservist semper fi they staked out territory and they did not give it uphodges had been part of the mets in the first goofy day in spring training when casey stengel wa filibustering to catch the public attention hodges wa happy to be back from los angeles in his wife home borough of brooklyn where he wa beloved for his grand decadeplus with the dodger his knee wa shot and marvin eugene throneberry check out the initial became the regular first baseman and an immortal met blundererthe mets were not adequate enough to benefit from hodgess boy of summer way of doing thing he became the manager of the washington senator for what some felt wa an apprenticeship for the mets job which he wa offered in seaver arrived from the farm system in after growing up fast in the marine and later learning the game under rod dedeaux at the university of southern california in some way seaver wa a normal young man in his early s full of energy a whooping laugh prank on teammate he could also do the new york time crossword puzzle and converse with writer when he wa playing he did not bring up his time in the marine corp reserve in but later he talked proudly about iti wa a mediocre student seaver recalled on veteran day nov at a ceremony in manhattan honoring military veteran if it didnt have a ball involved i wasnt much interested but the marine sharpened his focusthe principle that i learned in boot camp were the principle that i took to the mound he said focus dedication i wouldnt have made it without the marine corpsseaver mentioned a picture taken of him on the mound locked into attention during the playing of the national anthem you look at my foot theyre in military position absolutely he said thats the discipline that wa instilled in me it a very important reason why im in cooperstownit is not clear how much seaver and hodges discussed their marine root with each other they had served under vastly different circumstance seaver stateside hodges facing incoming kamikaze pilot in the pacific theaterhodges wa a college boy from southern indiana noticeable because of his muscle stengel on one of his franchisebuilding conversational ramble once said that hodges wa so strong he could squeeze your earbrows off nobody knew what an earbrow wa and nobody wanted to aski had a mentor in the newspaper business who had been a young columbia university dropout and baseball freak sent to the island of okinawa there were rumor that a large young marine on the island wa a major league ballplayer the dodger had let hodges play one game at third base in before he shipped outon okinawa my friend heard rumor that hodges had been in handtohand combat but that rumor ha been deflated by mort zachter the author of gil hodges a hall of fame life published in hodges wa awarded a bronze star with the citation mentioning his duty supporting his commanding officer in a dangerous zone but there is no mention of his being in direct combat he surely saw death all around himwhen hodges became a star with the dodger he often went to the movie in his free time a friend who accompanied him said hodges would grow solemn if there wa a scene of combat and he would pray amen at every fallen military personhodges carried his marine steel in the manager uniform when reporter made joke he smiled weakly and politely but he did not encourage levity or cynicismfew player challenged hodges except for the earnest and curious young outfielder ron swoboda otherwise known a rocky who had grown used to the garrulous oration of stengeli would sit and listen to him swoboda said of the old man in it would sound a if he wa speaking in stengelese but all of a sudden id say hey man this guy is telling a parable and it aimed at meby casey wa three full season into retirement and gil hodges wa the manager when youre young and full of yourself you do thing you regret swoboda said gil sometimes made me feel he wa rubbing our nose in his authority but that wa me that wa my faulti remember one time early in he held a meeting and he said you guy are professional you set your own curfew and somebody suggested two and a half hour after the game and gil said it wa too long and i popped up gil why dont you just tell u i would do my thing like that why didnt i just shut upone player who wa definitely in tune with hodges wa the thirdyear pitcher tom seaver on may seaver beat the brave in atlanta to bring the mets to an record the latest in their first eight season that they had been eventom tom babbled one of the regular reporter not me but it easily could have been youre a ball club arent you going to celebrateseaver who could be garrulous when he wanted to be gave u the hodges starewhats so good about seaver snapped thats only mediocre we didnt come into the season to play ball im tired of the joke about the old metsand he wasnt done seaver then invoked two fanandwriter favorite from the first few year of the metslet rod kanehl and marvelous marv laugh about the mets were out here to win you know when well have champagne when we win the pennantseaver and hodges seemed to have similar drill instructor in the marine hodges wa changing the work habit of the team backed up by having talented young player at his command nobody wa exempt from protocol one day he trudged slowly out to left field and inquired about the health of cleon jones his best hitter who had pursued a ball a little too slowly for hodgess taste the manager then escorted jones to the dugout and fan and writer wondered if he might have lost jones instead jones played well down the stretchthose of u who were around in the year of marvelous marv never thought the mets even with those young arm could ever win anything but they did win the pennant and they did spray champagnejust before the world series seaver wa asked about the national antiwar protest planned for oct he wa quoted a asking what is so unpatriotic about being against such a terrible war he touched off some debate and stopped commenting on the war but he had made his pointthe mets won the world series in five game and they sprayed everybody all over again seaver being one of the chief celebrantsin that stunning autumn we did not think of seaver and hodges a exmarines but now it seems that some of their discipline wa part of those amazing metsgeorge vecsey wrote about the mets in the s for newsday and the new york timesadvertisement
advertisementsupported byby kevin armstrongport st lucie fla when mets manager mickey callaway considered the body in his clubhouse at the start of spring training he noted an improvementwe have way more depth than weve ever had he saidhe mentioned his stockpile of four catcher who could work in the major league this season at first base he welcomed a fourman competition among pete alonso dominic smith j d davis and todd frazierwere excited that it going to be kind of a battle royale for a bunch of position this year he saidthat battle ha become something of a war of attrition within day of arriving in camp jed lowrie the utility infielder who signed a twoyear contract worth million in the offseason wa flown back to new york to learn that he had a sprained knee capsule frazier followed the same flight path to a doctor office a few day later with a left oblique strain that required a cortisone shot the setback forced callaway to start mixing and matching his grapefruit league lineup before march commencedunforeseen thing are going to happen he said thats just the reality of baseballoutfielders have not been immune to the rash of injury jeff mcneil slated to start in left field wa scratched from the lineup two day after scraping his left wrist while diving for a batted ball during a game center fielder brandon nimmo missed action because of an upset stomach after cooking chicken for himselfwere going to have to teach him how to cook so he doesnt miss any more game callaway saidthe unfortunate ha been familiar to the mets of late last spring outfielder tim tebow tripped on a sprinkler head during his first workout over the summer pitcher noah syndergaard received a diagnosis of hand foot and mouth disease in the fall david wright retired because of chronic neck and shoulder ailment all were reminder that the best plan can go sideways quicklywith opening day le than a month away here is how the roster looksinfielders who at first it depends on the day alonso led off the exhibition season with a solo home run in his first atbat and davis who can play first or third countered by blasting a tworun homer a he went for a a designated hitterthe mets are surehanded up the middle with robinson cano bringing his nifty fielding and a smooth stroke to second base shortstop amed rosario will be a running threat on the base and adeiny hechavarria a late pickup who previously played with the yankee cover u in so many way callaway saidwhen healthy lowrie who ha primarily played at second base and shortstop but is expected to start at third for mets will provide versatility so will frazier a veteran whose experience is valued in the clubhouseoutfielders yoenis cespedes who is recovering from operation on his heel is in camp and singing along to country song in the clubhouse but he will not be patrolling the outfield anytime soon callaway considers cespedes the icing on the cake if he can come back for a late summer runfor now center field belongs to nimmo mcneil who may need to be called into duty at third base will be in left and michael conforto will be in rightthere are plenty of leg with juan lagares and keon broxton playing reserve role but the mets also need hit last season only one team in the major had fewer hit than the mets the philadelphia phillies conforto and company will be counted on to put more ball in playstarting pitchersaccording to callaways calculation the mets should plan to use or pitcher this season jacob degrom who won the cy young award with a earned run average last season and syndergaard who posted a era will anchor the rotation both have looked healthy in workout and game actionzack wheeler went with a era down the stretch in the second half of last season and jason vargas wa with a era in his final eight start steven matz will try to build off a season with start a career highsyndergaard started on opening day last season he ended up with strikeout in ⅓ inning but missed start because of a strained ligament in his right index finger and the hand foot and mouth diseasethe only certainty is who will take the ball on opening day in washingtoni think jacob decided that last june callaway saidbullpen cano headlined the sevenplayer trade that brought him back to new york during the offseason but edwin diaz the yearold closer who collected save in chance for seattle last year may be the most important part of the transaction for the metsjeurys familia once the closer return a the setup man in six and a half season with the mets before he wa traded to oakland last summer he saved game and his era wa seth lugo can set up close or startcatchers wilson ramos ha been well received by the pitching staff he look fresh after spending the offseason working on agility drill and convincing general manager brodie van wagenen that he can do the job despite twice tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right kneetravis darnaud is returning from tommy john surgery and devin mesoraco is back behind the plate after catching of degroms start last seasonthough he can play other position darnaud will focus on catcher rather than risk injury during rehabilitation he could be an option elsewhere in the outfield or at first base depending on how the team depth hold upadvertisement

between third base and left field depending on the day and batting anywhere from leadoff to eighth so the thirdbase coach gary disarcina sat down and explained to him that he needed to eliminate some cluttermcneil proceeded to pull eight glove from his locker and pile them on the floor the last one he retrieved wa the most wornthats the gamer he saidmcneil is the mets most valuable grinder his blond goatee whisker and notable nimbleness earned him the nickname squirrel during his day diving for line drive a an outfielder at long beach state and he ha continued to pounce on any opportunityin his first major league atbat last summer he swung on the first pitch he saw for a base hit to center field and he ha kept connecting with his knobless bat ever since pulling double into right field

playing second and third last season backpedaled before the wind blew the ball over his right shoulder he turned all the way around in time for the ball to hit the palm of his glove it then popped out

the qualitycontrol coach luis rojas serving a his tutor i make that catch almost every timemcneil make up for any misstep in the field with his extraordinary resourcefulness which ha proved indispensable for the mets thus far for all their talk about their depth the mets have found themselves relying heavily on mcneil since infielder todd frazier and jed lowrie went down with injury in spring training neither ha played this seasonand mcneil ha managed to consistently be in the middle of the action in the early part of this season whether it wa stroking a foot triple collecting four hit in a game being hit by pitch three time in two day being caught in rundown twice or the time he made two of the three out in an inning in essence mcneil can be thrilling and a little maddeningi think baseball is kind of coming back around to those guy right fielder michael conforto said of his teammate it not so much about the guy who just launch ball i think you are seeing team value guy who play a lot of position and do all the little thing right steal base play defense and spray the ball all over the fieldwith his uncommon handeye coordination at the plate mcneils offense is ultimately the reason manager mickey callaway must find place for him to play though he can appear offbalance in the batter box at time mcneil patiently keep his hand back to wait on breaking ball to callaway mcneils approach rank somewhere on the swing spectrum between wade boggs and ichiro suzukiand no matter what happens at the plate teammate and coach eagerly await mcneils review of his own atbatsas conforto said if the pitcher get him out with something he come back and he say im going to get this guy if he throw me that pitch again im going to get him just constantly overflowing with confidenceit wa his batting that allowed him to finally break through selected in the th round of the draft mcneil languished in the minor until ripping through class aa and aaa last season with a combined average home run walk and rbi he continued to do the same after the mets called him up stitching together an game hitting streak during one stretch and batting over all in atbats with three homer six triple and rbi in a lost season for the mets mcneil at the advanced rookie age of wa something of a revelationthe mets appreciated mcneils ability enough to keep him out of the winter trade that brought closer edwin diaz and second baseman robinson cano from seattle to queen but the acquisition of cano in december and lowrie in january also meant that mcneil needed to expand his versatilityin spring training mcneil who also bulked up to pound wa slated to take percent of his assignment in left field but then lowrie went down with a knee injury the first week frazier slated for third base followed with an oblique strain mcneil moved to third picking grounder and talking positioning with frazier who ha played every spot in the major except pitcher catcher and center fieldhe is going to hit his way into the lineup frazier said you have to get your leg under you at each position because it is a lot of different movement everywhere you gomcneil will figure it out his unconventional path to the mets included playing baseball a a youth but then giving it up for golf when he got to high school he eventually competed against jordan spieth now a threetime winner of major golf tournament at the united state junior amateur championship in july spieth won the tournament but mcneil still wonder where he might have ended up if he had putted betterwho know where id be he saidtroy buckley the baseball coach at long beach state wa the ultimate beneficiary of mcneils transition back to baseball unable to secure a golf scholarship mcneil played baseball for the california wahoo in a scout league after his junior year of high school and committed to california state university northridge even before suiting up for nipomo high a a senior but the northridge coaching staff wa fired before mcneil ever made it to campus in turn northridge recommended mcneil to buckley who watched him play for one weekend and offered him a scholarship mcneil wa now a long

childhood friend peter kurz and we talked a we have been prone to do over many year about our lifelong obsession with the new york metswe recalled our preadolescent battery at the soldier and sailor monument on manhattan upper west side my imaginary tom seaver tossing fastball to his imaginary jerry grote we got everyone out of course willie stargell and roberto clemente frank and brook robinson too because that wa just the way tom terrific rolledthe mets inhabited our consciousness a happens when the hypnotic beauty of baseball sink it hook in kid those mets those world champion guy have been stepping into mortality shadow for year now tommie agee and donn clendenon ed charles and tug mcgraw all gone so we can not lay claim to shock that another star will now be moving off the stageexcept that seaver wa the immortal the forever young so composed and so fiercely competitive and so analytical about his effort now his family say that at age he suffers from dementia and we will see no more of him in public life he will tend to his vineyard in napa a long a he canread about the seaver family announcement that the baseball legend ha dementia and will retire from public life that is not how i will remember him and maybe thats the point of his withdrawal he wa a powerful stocky pitcher from california and he dominated his mound like a tenor astride his stage he would pull off his cap and run his hand through that thick shock of hair and then ready himself and rear and toss and rear and toss no need to put a second clock on him out there on his mound he wa pure business and if a batter fiddled around too much he just might sneak a hard fastball under the batter chin by way of a reminder to buckle downhe perfected the dropandthrust delivery dropping so far down a he threw that his measure of a good night wa whether his right knee had dirt on it from dragging on the mound no weight work and iron sled for him he ran and he worked out with light weight and still that fastball crackledmagic could happen any night he pitched and so you tried to wheedle your parent into letting you stay up and watch with them on the blackandwhite wor channel broadcast or youd curl up in bed with a transistor radio and listen to bob murphy paint the picture for you of seaver tossing and tossingdata can be a sportswriting crutch although it also true that baseball without statistic is like the bible without word so in seaver went with a earned run average he also threw five completegame shutoutsi recently took a look at the prevailing and too little questioned orthodoxy that starting pitcher should not go more than six or seven inning into a game by way of making a point seaver became my insane outlier if hitter wanted to get to him they were welladvised to swing early before seaver tuned up his curve and that live snake of a fastball his career era in the first inning of a game wa in the last three inning his lifetime era wa and forgive me my statistical drunkenness but peakperformance tom tilted into absurdity in he pitched in the ninth inning time and surrendered not a single runoh yes in september of that year he went with an era all this courtesy of baseballreferencecomseaver like his peer bob gibson and juan marichal and jim palmer grooved on competition that wa never more true than in when the mets became the most unlikely team in baseball history to reach the world series stumbling into the postseason with a motley record of many mets had been injured that season they fell into one ditch after another and yet somehow they dusted themselves off and made it to the series against the vastly more powerful oakland asthat series went a taut seven game and seaver facing off against reggie jackson wa alone worth the price of admission reggie had led the american league in home run and run batted in that year and seaver wa seaver with a era and strikeout reggie strutted to the plate wigglewagging his bat ready for the struggle seaver looked in to grote for the sign but there really wa not much doubt what the call would bemy mind eye recall seaver throwing more or le nothing but fastball mano a mano he got jackson and jackson got him seaver wa perhaps not at his best in that series a he actually lost a game and had a era he also struck out men in inningsthis fairy tale ended badly seaver wanted more money and the mets board chairman m donald grant who wa imperious to the point of selfsatire bridled at the help acting up goaded by dick young a reactionary columnist for the daily news grant sent seaver into exile in cincinnati if that city by the ohio river wa to be his elba he made do well enough going in his first year therenone of it felt right though he wa the essential met he returned in the midst of the mets dark age and the team lost game he wa an old man in baseball term the vigor had left his fastball but he still fashioned a reasonable season with a era he gave up up just hit in inningshe moved on an itinerant starter and won game at age for the white sox a year later he called it quits he had a hall of fame career one of the best in the history of the game and his cumulative career

advertisementsupported bysports of the timesby michael powellcan we talk starting pitcher or more to the point their ritual sacrifice on the altar of major league baseball analyticsi put this question to leo mazzone the former pitching coach for the atlanta brave and the custodian of one of baseball greatest rotation of starting pitcher greg maddux john smoltz and tom glavine hall of famers allthe playoff and world series offered a parade of twitchy manager yanking their starting pitcher after four inning summoning a parade of faceless reliever to throw one mindnumbing fastball after another for fraction of an inningthis is spectacular for the radar gun industry but is it watchable and good baseballi heard mazzone snorting on the other end of the phone line no no and no it is an embarrassment and insult the intelligence he said they are abusing pitcher and calling it smartmazzone imparted this gospel to his pitcher trying to heave ball a fast a you can is for musclebeach dolt a good pitcher throw at to percent of effort and make the pitch move and hit it location varies speed too a for the notion a pitcher can last but five or six inning before batter grow wise and clobber himpleasea high school coach asked me leo what do you think of analytics showing that pitcher struggle the third time through a lineup ill tell you want that is thats the manager covering his you know what he saidthe equation guy who run most major league team bow to holy verity no starting pitcher should throw more than pitch some starter should not throw a many a to admire the number of win a pitcher accumulates or to encourage him to toss a complete game is to expose yourself a a paleolithic huntergatherer pitching is all about whip and fip id explain the definition but then our head would hurt and a conga line of relief pitcherslook on a good day i dont drag my knuckle along the sidewalk of flatbush brooklyn i dig sabermetrics and back in the day treated bill james annual a religious text i keep a threefoothigh stack of the analyticsobsessed baseball prospectus at home but at risk of registering a a getoffmylawn crank so much of the wisdom about pitcher is dubiousi set to thinking about this after watching my mets spend much of november and december in a modestly lunatic attempt to trade noah syndergaard one of the national league best starting pitcher they appear to have failed at this selfmutilation now that they have retained two true ace syndergaard and jacob degrom the cy young award winner why not stretch them out and push them to go deeper into game what is the point in allowing an ace to pitch six inning before turning the ball over to a committee of anonymous relieversgame of the world series presented something of a nadir when los angeles dodger manager dave robert a bright fellow no doubt pulled his starting pitcher after he had yielded a single hit through six and a third inning and wa ahead the dodger ended up marching six reliever into that game lost and exited the world series the next daymazzone pulled out a few of his remaining hairsthe greatest teacher for a pitcher is start he say pitch and pitch and pitch let a pitcher find himselfthe problem is that so many pitching coach and manager are yesmen and dont want to challenge their front officestheres a sizable mound of statistical evidence to back such assertion at risk of giving the quadratic dude a seizure i turned to baseball reference and selected pitcher from the past halfcentury men who ran the gamut from solid to superb these are the sort of pitcher youd expect to see in the postseason and my list included bobby ojeda mike torrez steve avery tom browning tom seaver steve carlton ferguson jenkins and mazzones troika of hall of famers i examined their performance across game from beginning to endfor most good pitcher their worst inning wa the first once they found a rhythm and once pitch began to crackle they became progressively more difficult to hit tom seavers career earned run average in the first inning wa his era for the last three inning of a game that dreaded third and fourth time through the batting order stood at so current analytic wisdom doe a headstandby way of insane outlier seaver won game in and helped pitch the miracle mets to a world series championship he pitched the ninth inning time that season and surrendered not a single runthis is a familiar pattern mike mussina gave up fewer run on average in the seventh eighth and ninth inning than he did in the first three he wa at his best in the ninth inning the best inning for ron darling and david well wa the eighth requisite caveat by definition these pitcher were having a good outing if they made it to the late inningsif you hoped to beat dodger pitcher fernando valenzuela you were advised to start hacking early he had a career era of in the first inning when valenzuela wa still pitching in the ninth inning and he got there roughly time in his career his era wa luis tiant the red sox and cleveland ace wa nearly a tough he pitched just over time in the ninth inning and had an era of greg maddux had a era in his first three inning and a from the seventh inning through the ninth and while he possessed a good fastball it wa not a threedigit express train one spring training in the mids maddux who in a year career piled up fairly meaningful win asked to speak with the team young pitchersmazzone nodded sure thing mad dog whatever you want the coach lined up the young guy and maddux walked overyou know why i am a millionaire because i can put my fastball wherever i want to maddux told them do you know why i own beachfront property in la because i can change speed ok questionsmazzone wa not enraptured by pitch count he would not push pitcher to stupid extreme but he refused to hew to limit without basis in medical fact he had pitcher run and throw every day in between start and they had remarkably few injury in one threeyear stretch his pitcher missed a single startwe kept track of pitch and i had a clicker he said but if tommy glavine get a popup on a changeup hell im not counting thathe recalled a brave vice president by the name of henry aaron who offered advice about the danger of radar gun intoxication dont worry about pure speed aaron said you can run a jet airliner through the strike zone and i will figure out how to rope it down the line locate a ball that move at my knee and im outall of which brings me back to the mets a team ive followed for many often hapless decade their manager mickey callaway sound a enamored of pitch count a his peer are all of this seeps into the brainpan of young pitcher who labor under the impression that five or six inning constitute a day worksyndergaard is a fine pitcher and susceptible to the idiocy of the age a year ago he pumped iron in the offseason in hope of throwing even harder than mile per hour and that season he blew a muscle in his side he appears to accept

ended last year in the bronxthat fraction of an inch is what ultimately separated the red sox from the yankee in their divisional playoff series which boston won in four game if pearce had not anchored the toe of his right foot to first base a he did if the plastic cleat on the bottom of his shoe were a tiny bit shorter or if the throw to him wa slightly more off target the yankee might have won game and carried a planeload of momentum into a doordie game at fenway park potentially changing the course of the postseasonits a game and anything can happen at that point andrew benintendi the red sox left fielder said in boston last week luckily well never find outon tuesday night in the bronx pearce and the rest of the red sox will meet up with the yankee for the first time since that crucial play although the encounter will come with both team stumbling through the early part of the seasonthe red sox baseball defending champion are just after monday patriot day loss to baltimore at fenway the yankee meanwhile are just and have lost three straight series at homebut back on oct the yankee and red sox were two of the best team in baseball and were sweating out a tense and chaotic bottom of the ninth in game of an american league division series with boston securing the final out only when part of pearces right shoe stuck just barely to the base while he snared a throw from third baseman eduardo nunez in the webbing of his glovefor an instant time froze pearce wa splayed on the dirt with the ball still in his glove his body momentum having tugged his foot off the base the yankee gleyber torres who had raced desperately to first after hitting a weak grounder to nunez planted his left foot on the bag just a pearce fell on the other side of the diamond the yankee adeiny hechavarria the tying run had turned third base and wa headed for homehad this been the previous century or the early part of this one when fortune almost always favored the yankee over the red sox perhaps pearces foot would have disconnected prematurely from first base or the throw would have skidded away perhaps there would have been a different outcome in game and maybe in the seriesoh yeah said aaron boone the yankee manager who once authored a classic yankeesred sox ending of his own with a walkoff home run against boston in game of the american league championship series it the perfect gameofinches play in such a big spotbut this historic rivalry ha been turned on it head over the last year and when firstbase umpire fieldin culbreth pumped his fist to signal that torres wa out the red sox were on their way to the alcs and from there to their fourth world series title in this century and in a sense all because of a razorthin play by a foot player who is undersized for the position he playsim not the tallest first baseman in the world pearce acknowledged last week a he recalled the ending to game i have to use every bit of steve pearce i can find to get to the baseball i wa anchored to the bag and nothing nothing wa going to pull me off until i caught the ballpearce who turned over the weekend and ha played for seven team over the course of a year major league career said he doe not do yoga but he doe stretch a lot and demonstrated enough agility that night to catch the ball and clamp his foot to the base if only for an instantwhen culbrin made the out call red sox player charged out of the dugout to celebrate but boone with nothing more to lose requested a replay review hoping that pearces foot had indeed come off the bag before he caught the ballthe replay however confirmed that pearce through sheer willpower never lost contact with the basehis foot could have been off the base by this much brock holt one of his red sox teammate recalled last week a he put his right index finger next to his thumb allowing only a speck of light to seep through but it wasntthat pearce wa even in the game for the play wa a bit improbable acquired from toronto last june to add righthanded power to boston bench and give manager alex cora a platoon option at first base pearce wa not considered much of a fielderwhen we traded for him everybody just thought he wa bad cora said of pearces reputation in the field but he made some good stretch a few inch here or there could have changed the course of the seriespearce said he played shortstop in high school but an injury forced him to move to first base in college he played at indian river community college and the university of south carolina and he eventually settled into that position a a professional but his value centered more on his offensive punch which he would put on display in last year world series when he hit three home run against the los angeles dodger and ended up being voted the most valuable playerin game in the bronx cora might have even taken him out of the game in the bottom of the ninth for defensive purpose if his other first baseman mitch moreland had not been sidelined with an injured hamstring instead pearce wa manning first a the red sox closer craig kimbrel went to the mound needing just three out to squash the yankee for goodbut kimbrel with a seemingly safe lead wa erratic he walked two batter hit another and surrendered a single the yankee trailed with one out and the base loaded when gary sanchez hit a towering drive to left field which benintendi caught on the warning trackthe yankee now trailed with two out and runner on first and second yankee stadium wa alive and loud and the red sox were still in danger a torres came to the plate he slapped a breaking pitch from kimbrel slowly toward third and nunez charged scooped the ball and fired it sidearm toward pearceit wa a great play by nunez pearce said i read the ball out of his hand and i just moved to itwith his right foot tethered tenuously to the bag pearce moved his left foot toward third and his right hand went to the ground so he could brace himself a he stretched for nunezs rushed throwthe combination of the ball in his glove and his foot on the base lasted for a fraction of a second a small fraction at that but it wa long enoughi wasnt going to leave that base no chance pearce reiterated it wasnt going to happen just anchor the bag and be an athletetorres meanwhile said saturday that he knew he wa out but that he wa not overly impressed with pearces playit wa all right he said i think every first baseman in the big league can do that play no big deal for me he did a really good job but it a regular playeven if it wa a regular play if pearce had not made it the game would have continued and maybe the series too forcing the ever confident red sox to make one more standthen holt said with a smile we would have just won game advertisement

earned run average that wa easily the best in the major leaguesand they had used an opener only twice creating the position of opener essentially a reliever who start the game and work only an inning or two helped the ray surge to victory last season but the notion that tampa bay intended to blow up pitching a we know it wa always misguidedthe ray after all had the al cy young award winner last season blake snell and signed him to a fiveyear million contract extension in march their no starter charlie morton signed a a free agent in december and will earn million this season and next the highest salary in team historytheir third and fourth starter tyler glasnow and yonny chirinos both combined to go in their first five start allowing two run in inning with strikeout and four walksso yes the ray believe in elite starting pitching they do not believe in mediocre pitching of any kind and have not had much of it so farwe tried to put ourselves in a position to have a lot of interesting depth said chaim bloom the ray senior vice president for baseball operation there a lot of guy with great upsidemorton took year to realize his upside a a young pitcher with atlanta and pittsburgh he finally discovered it with the houston astros when he learned to attack hitter with curveballs and high fastball instead of trying to induce contact with sinker he won game of the american league championship series and of the world series in and earned his first allstar selection last seasonmorton too love the traditional role of a starting pitcheri grew up idolizing starting pitcher so from a fan standpoint and from someone thats been a starter his whole career essentially i would like to see starting pitcher always have a place in the game morton said there a balance between the poetic nature of the game the nostalgic part of it how the game flow the mystical part of it and the winloss part that you have to win were trying to find a balance in thatlast summer after trading chris archer to pittsburgh for glasnow and outfielder austin meadow and nathan eovaldi to boston the ray found that balance with regular use of the opener allowing pitcher like chirinos and ryan yarbrough to work the bulk of a game after a reliever had gone through a few tough hitter to startchirinos pitched four to seven inning in each of his last appearance last season without starting any of those game his era in those game wa yarbrough went over all but started only six time the ray will adjust their role this season based on matchup to maximize their chance of success and avoid that dreaded mediocritythe yankee and the boston red sox will always have a significant financial edge on the ray whose million payroll is le than the combined salary of the yankee giancarlo stanton masahiro tanaka and jacoby ellsburybut tampa bay is supplementing it major league roster with product from a farm system that baseball america ranked no in the game after san diegos shortstop wander franco pitcher brent honeywell and the twoway player brendan mckay all rank among mlbcoms top prospectsthats where we have to be bloom said weve put a lot of effort over the last few year into making sure the system wa a deep and robust a possible we need depth we need topend talent and we need to have a steady flow of championshipcaliber player so we put a lot of energy and focus on thatit is very early of course but those young player have helped the ray open their biggest lead in the al east since midmay when they led by two and a half gamestheir only current player who wa on a major league roster then morton naturally with a home in bradenton fla and four young child he ha found the perfect spot for a contract he said would be the last of his careeri didnt know what to expect just because historically the ray havent spent a lot of money on freeagent starting pitching ever morton said so i wasnt thinking im the guy when they called and we got the impression they were going to be pretty aggressive i started to get excited and my wife got excited we tried not to get our hope up because we knew that this wa an ideal situation but for it to work out the way it did it kind

every season since major league baseball ha been searching for way to stimulate action on the field the independent atlantic league will be a testing ground for some experimental playing rule the most radical proposal wa scheduled to take effect at midseason with the distance between the pitching rubber and home plate moved back by two foot to foot incheson wednesday the atlantic league announced that this change would be delayed until the second half of the season and that another change the use of radar tracking technology to help umpire call ball and strike would be introduced gradually this season not on opening day in late aprilgiven the fragile nature of pitcher arm moving back the mound for the first time since would seem to invite even further injury risk the change could also discourage pitcher from joining the atlantic league because of possible injury and because the distance in affiliated ball where the athlete aspire to be remains any pitcher that ha significant major league time i think would be very apprehensive to try to make that change at that stage of his career said the agent tom oconnell whose client jon niese signed with the long island duck on wednesday

surgery ottavino struggled mightily in he logged a earned run average and walk in inning and wa left off the playoff roster i knew the next year wa do or die for my career ottavino said but thats the stuff i really enjoy attacking the root of the problem it better that i hit rock bottom because i wasnt holding on to anything id done beforea power pitcher with a dominant slider ottavino decided his command and consistency needed fixing having spent time at driveline a datadriven performance training center in washington state he determined that videotaping every practice session would be his answer rather than making adjustment based on feel or opinion fully committed to coaching himself he bought two camera a rapsodo to measure spin rate and a highspeed edgertronic sc that compress each

with trade and signing carlos beltran wa sitting among them learning how to use the club internal network to view video and file scouting reportsin december a year after considering him for their managerial vacancy the yankee hired beltran a ninetime allstar who spent two and a half season with the yankee a a special adviser to general manager brian cashman while frontoffice position like special adviser or special assistant can often be nebulous role handed to former manager coach or player who assist at their leisure alex rodriguez mariano rivera and david wright to name a few cashman said beltran wa approaching his job with a fulltime student mindsetsome parachute in and out which is great cashman said but some are heavily invested and he is heavily investedbeltran retired in after finally winning a world series with the houston astros the title capped what some believe is a career with hall of fame credential home run fourth most by a switchhitter hit and three gold glove award in addition to his allstar selectionsand after earning more than million over year in the major league beltran could be doing anything now such a sitting on the beach in his native puerto rico but he ha chosen to work in the yankee front office writing his version of scouting report and counseling the younger player throughout the organizationi had a career in baseball i played at a high level and i made a lot of money in the big league but man i want these kid to accomplish their dream he said in spanish during spring training at the team facility in tampa fla those were my dream toobefore the yankee settled on aaron boone a their replacement for joe girardi before the season cashman asked beltran to interview for the manager opening beltran had just finished playing and thus had no background in management but cashman admired beltran for his experience his commanding presence and his genuine personalitytheres passion and joy he brings every day cashman said he capable of anything he want to doso cashman contacted beltran again this time about a frontoffice position beltran who life in new york told cashman what he wa interested in working on and cashman gave him the freedom to do so for beltran the chance to learn the intricacy of the front office from cashman who ha won four world series during his two decade a the yankee general manager wa enticingnow it my turn to ask a lot of question see what interest me and knock on the needed door to learn baseball from another point of view beltran saidfor beltran that view is from the stand where the scout sit and analyze the yankee minor league team during the season it a different perspective but beltran gave himself plenty of training for his new job during his playing day on road trip he often spent traveling time watching video of the opposing team pitcher and hitter on his ipad and then shared his written note with teammate and coach if his team wa trading for a new teammate he would call friend on the player former team to get the lowdown on the new acquisition and his personalityim passionate about this he said since i lived the game i dont just talk about the visual aspect but the feeling of the player or what he might be thinking in difficult situation that sometimes analytics can not see the front office look a lot at the number but im talking about the mental side that ha value it a cool combinationbeltran spent the winter writing and filing note on several dozen player mostly on prospect in the yankee system but also some major leaguers it took him minute to watch video on a player and write up his thought he said he averaged two per dayhes breaking swing down and he breaking down the pitching mechanic said matt daley the yankee assistant director of pro scouting he getting pretty detailed it good informationbeltran ha also given the yankee his perspective on how prospect can be helped to develop particularly those from latin america a a player beltran encouraged club to hire spanishlanguage interpreter to prevent message from getting lost in translation between player and the team or reporter language barrier still persist today he said and can be factor in player growthhes speaking from the perspective of a guy who just off the field and see it through a player lens which is a unique aspect said tim naehring the yankee vice president for baseball operation we dont have many other guy writing report or putting their opinion down coming from a teammate side of thingsbeltran will also counsel player throughout the season a he did during two trip to the yankee spring training this year he will juggle that plus time at home with his wife and three young child and his baseball academy in puerto riconow it about how i can impact the younger player he said if they can get something out of one conversation or one bit of advice then at the end of the day thats your legacyamong the player beltran ha advised are infielder gleyber torres and outfielder estevan florial the team top prospect who broke a wrist during spring training torres who is from venezuela said he had sought out beltran for tip on improving his focus and taking better care of his bodyill keep talking to him and if anything is needed i have the trust to ask and know hell have an answer torres saidflorial who is from the dominican republic said beltran had advised him on how to better use his leg in his swing and how to sharpen aspect of his defense to take the time to help someone who isnt even a bigleaguer is really great he saidso how do all these responsibility fit into beltrans future asked if he wanted to run a team one day either a a manager or a an executive beltran would say only that he loved baseball and wanted to learn new skillsthis will help me if in some future i want to manage then i understand how an organization think how to develop an organization and how they evaluate player he said but in the future if i say that managing isnt for me maybe i want to be more involved in a front office i have more toolsadvertisement
april i wanted to understand why i kept shooting myself in the foot i wish it wa in the foot actually arod on doping getting therapy and no longer being the villainalex rodriguez ha in retirement fashioned a comeback that far exceeds any reversal he engineered on a baseball field it wasnt all that long ago that the former yankee wa one of professional sport biggest bad guy and not without reason he wa suspended for the season for violating the league antidoping rule even aside from that he wa widely considered to be vain and disingenuous especially in his hometown the new york post honored him with ahole and arat cover line following allegation that he used performanceenhancing drug but three year after his last game rodriguez newly engaged to jennifer lopez is a respected baseball broadcaster a warm and selfdeprecating presence on social medium and a deferential businessman you couldnt exactly call his image rehabilitation organic given how hard he worked at it but it ha no doubt been successful i tried to build a certain image while i wa playing rodriguez said and that plan failed miserably now he explained simply i have more claritywhat have you learned that would have made dealing with the press easier a a player what ive learned is that a lot of it wa selfinflictedwhat specifically i represented myself the wrong way coming out of the suspension i wanted to be honest be accurate and be fair with the medium and mix in levity i could not wait to make fun of myself doing that made everybody relax about me id wake up the next morning thinking i wa going to get crushed by them for a mistake id made but then id see that theyd barely be talking about my expletive up because id beat them to the punch i still think that for the most part i had a good relationship with the medium but it became excellent postsuspensiondid the depiction of you a a villain feel like a misrepresentation i would have booed me too i felt that being the tough guy who had all the answer and being robotic wa the right thing to do i wa wrong and now i think it ok if i say i dont know the answerthis is almost more of a philosophical thing but baseball ha a long history of player using performance enhancer ball four talk about guy gobbling amphetamine before game and im thinking of that in conjunction with a point malcolm gladwell once made in the new yorker about how player arent allowed to take peds but it ok for them to get tommy john surgery which is also a completely unnatural method of aiding your career doe it seem at all arbitrary that baseball say peds are cheating but certain other thing arent i dont know i think with time well be able to determine whats whatof all the bigtime baseball player who were implicated during the steroid era you seem to have done the best better than guy like barry bond or roger clemens at coming out of that controversy in a positive way why is that i can not speak about anybody else if youre asking about me i think it started with taking full responsibility for my misstep i paid a huge price the longest suspension in the history of mlb for ped use and while i wa away i took that year to reflect i wanted to understand why i kept shooting myself in the foot i wish it wa in the foot actuallywhat understanding did you arrive at im still a work in progress but one thing i learned wa that i wa good enough i did not need to overreach and when i turned the lens inward i found this incredible amount of gratitude and appreciation and respect for others and myself in a way that perhaps wa not there in the past with that attitude i wa able to enjoy life better it made me a nicer person to be around it made me a better fatherbefore making the personal realization youve described how distorting wa fame to your selfconception and decisionmaking i went to my high school prom and several month later i wa playing at fenway park i wa good enough physically to be there but mentally i wa still in high school i never make excuse for myself but not benefiting from being on a college campus for four year and having the time to evolve i lost my way somewhere along the linehow aware were you of any emotional disconnect in the moment you know when something doesnt feel right what you find is that and ive never thought about it this way before you suppress that voice thats telling you not to do the wrong thingthis is maybe a shot in the dark but did the suspension really cause this degree epiphany for you or wa it maybe more that it and it aftermath gave you a way of understanding your own story that allowed you to move forward emotionally and publicly well when the suspension first happened i wa pissed off at everyone i wa blaming everyone it wasnt until i got deeper into it that i said no it not their fault it your faultwere you in therapy at the time thats when i got into itis there any culture of therapy in majorleague baseball whats more common in baseball is performance coach thats totally different than deep therapy which is serious business it wa the hardest thing ive ever had to do in many way it rewiring the brainbefore your suspension did you or your adviser ever discus just coming clean about peds or wa the strategy always deny deny deny this part i want you to make sure that were superclear because i want this to be a story thats about the fact and it not me trying to expletive you i think i didnt have the tool that i have today let go to the next one david and well come back to this because thats real important i want to make sure that i address that in a clear wayhow consciously a youve transitioned out of playing have you tried to build a new brand or persona for yourself today i showed up here with you and i didnt know anything youd want to talk to me about and id rather have it be that way before i would have studied for six month before sitting down with you i wanted to be more buttonedup and have done due diligence and seen what your angle wa now i just trust were going to have a good conversation and i go for itwhat persona or brand were you trying to build back then robotic tough very serioushow did that detail photo shoot where you were kissing your reflection in a mirror fit in with that image i cringe at that we were ending the photo shoot and i wanted to run out of there i think steven klein wa the photographer and he wa like let just shoot one more and im like what i just want to eat a burger let me get out of herewere burger part of your diet back then no but i wa probably starving yeah i just kissed the mirror not even thinking but i did a lot of thing like that i took my shirt off at central park and decided to get sun in the middle of the dayknowing that people would see you and take photograph right in central parkyes no because you think youll just do this for to minute and get some sun im pale a hell again even those situation if i would have handled them with some levity and more humility i would have defused the entire thingtheres that rumor about your having a portrait of yourself a a centaur percent not true i wish it wa true because it such a cool storywhat ha jennifer lopez taught you about being a public figure shes obviously skilled at it ive never met anyone who more honest shes so authentic and genuine it wa strange to see someone of such magnitude be so normal be such a great mother and partner and friend how can you be like this and then go perform in front of people but thats her superpowerwhy ha balancing your public and private self in that way been more of a struggle for you i dont know i wish i didhow hard wa the cultural transition from sport to business there financial language thats different but in other way theyre exactly the same what you want to do is create a winning culture where incentive package are based on the team winning if youre not careful and you put in the wrong incentive package you can create a culture where everyone is fighting for themselves the same thing go in baseballthere is that expectation in sport that player will sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the team but if each professional athlete is his or her own business arent the personal incentive fundamentally at odds with the incentive of the team management who are rewarded for team performance or is the whole ethos of subsuming your individual selfinterest into the team a bunch of romantic horse crap perpetuated by those who have a vested interest in athlete continuing to think that way look i played for year and won one championship dan marino and charles barkley they didnt have championship and to this day i know they hear the echo i feared that so wa an amazing experience but the other half wa relief but i also had already made a small fortune itd probably be different if you asked me when i hadnt signed my contract then that becomes a question of would you rather hit and not win or and win thats where it get a little trickybecause that battingaverage difference equates to a difference of million of dollar in salary ten of million but there are unique player that are truly all about winning johnny damon derek jeter andy pettitte dustin pedroiado you include yourself on that list i do i do i also had an incredible passion to be great but yeah probably i do thats why i moved over to third base from shortstop thats an example of putting the team ahead of myselfyour life a a baseball player wa so regimented do you miss that structure i have a predictable a schedule a i can but nothing will be a predictable a a baseball season i wa in love with that structure i had a list of my thing i had to do and i would check it every night before i went to bed to see how many id done i wa maniacal about my work ethic when i wa about year old i played with a guy by the name of joey cora he foot on a good day he had knee problem and i saw him arriving at the stadium at in the morning for a oclock game i saw the way he took care of his body all the work he did to get ready to play and here i wa a young shortstop hitting im going down the stretch competing for the mvp and nothing hurt i felt like i could rip through a wall and the wall would hurt right god those were the good old day but i remember sitting down and watching joey cora and im like his body hurt he doesnt complain he just get to the clubhouse earlier and earlier and i said if i can take my godgiven ability and have his type of hunger and desire ill take my chancesdo you still have a checklist you look at every night i do im old school i remember thing better if i write them out the other day jennifer said something brilliant at like in the morning i reached over to get my notebook and everything fall on the floor then i grabbed it and wrote it downwhatd she say it wa about mariano rivera she said mo getting percent tell you more about his greatness off the field than it doe on the field i thought thats so true i played with him all these year and i couldnt have come up with thatwhen you were playing did you ever see another player and think he wa better than you if you take away my first year and my last season i dont think i ever saw thatwould the answer be different if youd played against barry bond i played against barry interleaguedo you look up to anyone in the business world the way a a kid you looked up to say cal ripken think about what jamie dimon ha done at jp morgan barry sternlicht at starwood jon gray at blackstone obviously our babe ruth is warren buffettbuffetts philanthropy is impressive my passion in giving back is for education ive had an opportunity to coteach a class at stanford business schoolwhat wa the class reputation managementwas the key lesson authenticity that wa definitely up there and not being afraid of pivotingsomething a shortstop is good at how did getting rich at a young age change your relationship with the people around you you have a young kid who learned how to play baseball at the boy girl club then you climb through the system you become the no draft pick you bypass college at you get over million in a contract which is crazy then you get a contract that break the alltime record in sport usually journey have an arc of many year but this all happened to me in seven or eight year after high school so it wa a culture shock for me and those around me there no preparation for itwhat were the effect of that culture shock people around you think that you have all that cash whatever they read in the paper you signed for they feel like someone came in a brink truck and dumped all the money in your garage and for whatever reason some people think wheres my cut when that doesnt happen for them it can grow into resentment and disappointmentlets revisit the question i wa asking earlier before being suspended wa the idea of coming clean about peds ever discussed ive taken the position of just owning everything at some point and maybe it in the future i feel like this is an answer i would like to give oncamera because i think people have to see my sincerity im giving it to you straight because i respect you and i dont want you to think that im expletive you in any way so thats why id rather step away and say david id rather not answer that because im not ready to give that truth yet doe that make sensei think i understand what youre saying whats the one piece of advice you have for other athlete trying to transition into business you have to find people that are experienced conservative have alignment with you and have a moral compass there are so many pitfall along the way and if someone doesnt have a moral compass therell be troubledavid marchese is the magazine talk columnistthis interview ha been edited and condensed for clarity from two

image of winning a pennant and hoisting the world series trophy are far more realistic for some the yankee includedtheir season of high expectation at the tail end of a championshipless decade began thursday afternoon with a booming first chapter with a formula they expect to ride often this year the yankee toppled the baltimore oriole behind power hitting and pitchingdesignated hitter luke voit provided the bulk of the power by smashing the team first home run of the season a threerun shot in the first inning he drove in another run when he wa hit by a pitch with the base loaded in the fifth ultimately accounting for four run with a blast and a bruisethere wa more offense to come after his homer but voits contribution proved more than enough against the rebuilding oriole in front of a crowd of at yankee stadiummasahiro tanaka starting because of a shoulder injury to the ace luis severino earned his first openingday victory in four try a a yankee he allowed two run one earned and struck out five batter over five and twothirds inning then stepped aside for the onslaught that is the yankee new and improved bullpenit wa an ideal way to go about a game a far a pitching go tanaka saidthere wa little anxiety for the pitching staff thanks to the yankee potent lineup after setting a major league record with home run last season the yankee predicted they would top that this yearwith two home run in their first game they are on a pace to do so first baseman greg bird also homered to rightcenter field in the eighth inning the blast helped cancel out a few boo for bird who had struck out in each of his first three atbatsbut on thursday at least it all started with voit about a year ago he wa with the st louis cardinal class aaa team in memphis the yankee needing a first baseman because of injury and underperformance saw voit a an undervalued player and acquired him in a minor trade in julygiven a chance to play he proved crucial to the yankee playoff push he hit home run in game and started all of the yankee playoff game he battled bird for the firstbase job this year but both ended up on the openingday roster thanks to a nagging back injury to center fielder aaron hicksand on voits first major league opening day the yankee trusted him with the power spot of the lineup fourth behind his fellow slugger aaron judge and giancarlo stanton after judge and stanton singled off oriole starter andrew cashner voit came up and saw a low slider on his fifth pitch listed at foot inch and pound voit and his powerful swing sent the ball over the centerfield fenceto have that first opening day and hit a home run is pretty special voit said and something ill remember for the rest of my lifea couple of caveat should be noted with the victory it wa against the oriole who had the worst record in baseball last season on the other hand this yankee squad is not yet wholepitcher c c sabathia is serving a fivegame suspension stemming from an incident in which he threw at jesus sucre last fall and will have to spend addition time on the injured list a he is still building up from offseason operation on his heart and a knee he is expected to return sometime

up their pitching staff this winter they traded prospect for starting pitcher james paxton and spent million most of it either resigning or adding starting pitcher ja happ and sabathia and relief pitcher zack britton and adam ottavinowe won game last year and were even better than we were last year stanton saidglimpses showed on thursday ottavino a newcomer who grew up a yankee fan in brooklyn

hobbled player the yankee can take some encouragement from recent historythe last major league team to have this many player on the il six game into the season wa the los angeles dodger according to nathan currier of the injurytracking site mangameslostcom buoyed by a deep million roster the dodger went on to win the national league west and advance to the nl championship series that year despite setting a record with player on the ilso really it could always be worse for the yankee at one point last june the los angeles angel had player out with injury and reinforcement are on the way

their improved depth entering this season having bolstered the pitching staff and added infielder d j lemahieu a gold glovewinning everyday second baseman with the colorado rockies who wa signed to be a jackofalltrades bench player in new york but the yankee did not expect to reach so far into that depth this early after tulowitzki went down the only healthy infielder on the man roster to call up wa thairo estrada the yankee thranked prospect who missed most of last season because he wa shot in the right hip during a robbery attempt in his native venezuela during the winter estradas stay in the major league lasted one game a the yankee swapped his spot for infielder giovanny urshela a stout defender with some past major league experience who will play a lot of third basethe star infielder manny machado a free agent this offseason would help the yankee immensely now but they decided over the winter that his asking price wa too high he eventually signed with the san diego padre for what wa a record million over year and they could spread their money around with various addition while relying on gleyber torres andujar lemahieu and tulowitzkithe result wa an opening day payroll of nearly million le than what it wa in million and million according to cot baseball contract the yankee are over the million luxurytax threshold because that take into account the entire man roster and yearly salary are calculated differentlythat roster the secondmost expensive in the major behind the red sox ha hobbled out of the gate but manager aaron boone ha maintained the long viewwere always capable of going on a roll he said thats a matter of time thats a matter of u starting to click all together and getting some guy hot collectively in the lineup and getting our pitcher

season while voit ended the season on a hitting tear then there is the potential for growth from player who underperformed last season such a catcher gary sanchez who is coming off his worst season in the major and had an operation on his nonthrowing shoulder in the offseasonand even amid all that depth the roster still includes obvious weak spot the yankee will go slow with sabathia who is and entering his final majorleague season since his offseason training wa slowed by knee and heart surgery boone said sabathias first bullpen session would not take place for a couple more week another reason to avoid any rush sabathia still must serve a fivegame suspension for throwing at jesus sucre of the tampa bay ray last septemberof all the announcement boone made on wednesday the least surprising one involved jacoby ellsbury boone said ellsbury who ha two year and more than million left on his contract and who ha not played since the end of the season because of injury would not join the yankee in tampa until next month because of an issue with the plantar fascia in one of his feetbut ellsbury wa never likely to figure significantly into a packed outfield the yankee have aaron judge giancarlo stanton aaron hick and brett gardner a the primary option in the outfieldit all add up to on paper at least the trapping of a contending team but a long road lie aheadits early february boone said so in a lot of way the talk about it is cheap we have tremendous expectation and we rightfully have those expectation but weve got to go out and do itinside pitchluis severino declined to address his pending arbitration hearing with the yankee nor a report that the side had held preliminary discussion over a contract extension severino who will turn next week is eligible for salary arbitration in for the first time in his career and will not be a free agent until after the season he filed for a salary of million with the yankee countering at millionfollow james wagner

johnson started his coaching career in at abundant life high school in sherwood ark he quickly learned what he needed to win invariably his team would end their season by losing close playoff game to dominant pitcher johnson began a quest to find out how to build an acehis skill at doing so led to several college job most recently a the pitching coach for the university of arkansas his platform for an unusual leap this season to the minnesota twin johnson is believed to be the first pitching coach to jump from college to the major leaguesin johnson first game on march starter jose berrios and the bullpen gave him just the kind of victory that once eluded him a gem over the cleveland indian the twin totaled strikeout in each game in their threegame opening series an encouraging sign for a staff that ha struggled for year to master the art of power pitchingthe indian have no such trouble four of their starter topped strikeout last season helping the team win it third consecutive american league central title for the twin to challenge they need johnson pitcher to respond to his modernized approach which relies heavily on biomechanicsim going to come in and tell them the why johnson said repeating what he told the twin top baseball official derek falvey and thad levine in his job interview the biggest thing is why are we doing something and it not going to be a subjective why it going to be percent objective through science or through their data if were going to make a change to a guy we cant just make a change because it doesnt please our eyesjohnson personifies a trend in baseball pairing techsavvy coach with a generation of player who crave actionable data the coach pitching background is largely irrelevant like johnson the new pitching coach for the los angeles angel doug white the seattle mariner paul davis and the cincinnati red derek johnson formerly of the milwaukee brewer never pitched in an affiliated professional leaguethose are the four that maybe never did anything never played pro ball that are going to be cutting edge said brent strom the pitching coach for the houston astros im just glad im getting out now while theyre coming up i might just slyly get out of here and let them take over these guy they know their stuffbefore his college coaching career which wound through central arkansas dallas baptist mississippi state and arkansas johnson connected with strom through pat harrison a mutual friend strom invited johnson to a clinic featuring paul nyman a pioneer in sport science who emphasized momentum over balance in a pitcher delivery with research rather than conventional wisdom to support his theoriesat smaller college especially johnson tended not to have the most polished prospect who had signed professionally or chosen larger program to compete he specialized in development imparting the lesson he learned from nyman strom and others like ron wolforth the founder of the texas baseball ranch who hosted clinic they all attendedwolforth cited johnson personality and curiosity a reason for his unlikely risehes so bubbly and he just bounce off the wall with energy wolforth said for those first year or so from high school to central arkansas to dallas baptist he started to experiment with some thing and find out what worked and a he did that he would add the next brick some thing were just accepted dogma but wes wa really interested in a different perspective he looked at thing upside downfalvey a former indian executive who joined the twin a chief baseball officer in october met johnson at a wolforth clinic and followed him from afar when the twin fired paul molitor a manager after last season and restructured the coaching staff falvey a former pitcher at trinity college turned to johnson intrigued by his many year of studying the crafttheres an argument to be made that in college circle in the last few year anyway they may have been using more information and technology than we were on the pro side falvey said adding later in the professional game the traditional way of getting on the field wa you finish playing and you become a coach there wa no real inbetween step of learning and developingstrom did pitch professionally for five major league season in the s but his astros pitcher respond to him because of his information and ability to convey it the astros staff led the major in strikeout last season and strom said the twin could be similarly transformedtheyre going to be much much better because of wes he said for year the twin had always had the reputation of inducing contact so they wouldnt strike out many people it reminded me of when i wa with the cardinal induce ground ball sinker that kind of stuff wes is bringing fourseam fastball elevated pitch sequencing pitch and he know the delivery very well because he studied itit just go to show you that player dont really care who you are they care if you care and wes really care he care for the playersthe twin have needed a change in the eight full season since their last division title in they had the fewest strikeout per nine inning in the major just they were pitching to contact with poor result allowing a average on ball in play in those season worse than every staff except colorado and inducing soft contact just percent of the time matching arizona for the worst such figure according to fangraphslast season though the twin set a franchise record for strikeout almost precisely the league average but they also issued walk their most in year johnson said the twin would use data to devise more effective pitch sequence tailored to each pitcher stuff and physiologyive been asked that question whats your pitching philosophy johnson said well ive got one for mike pineda ive got a completely different one for martin perez or kyle gibson or jake odorizzi because their body work different their stuff play different they need different thing in the training room some guy need more momentum some guy dont need a much momentum some guy throw across their body because theyve got loose hip so you may not change that guy but another guy who throw across his body because he got tight hip youve got to change himthat last idea brought a smile to jim kaat the ace of the twin al championship team kaat now a television analyst for the twin and mlb network thrived under the pitching

faultthe mets are learning that talk with van wagenen are forever ongoing his first impression with people across the organization have been indelible and largely audible he ha wasted little time becoming the voice of the team taking over after the eightyear tenure of sandy alderson and immediately bringing in veteran player new staff member and a winnow philosophy and doing so while keeping up nearconstant conversation inside and outside the organizationi always err on the side of overcommunication in hope that people will appreciate my transparency he said i have a hard time turning off my brainomnipresent in prada sneaker with his hair gelled just so the former agent patrolled his new fief with an energetic gait at the mets spring training base he jotted note in a black pad and covered his mouth with it when he knew he wa in the outfield camera frame sitting behind home plate he pulled up stool in the clubhouse to speak with former client like outfielder yoenis cespedes and offered fist bump through chainlink fenceshe brings a kind of swag a confidence said outfielder brandon nimmo who wa a van wagenen clientthat attitude wa welcomed after backtoback losing season in

the extension a the last word of his first offseasonwe havent been shy about who we want to be and how we plan to get to that place van wagenen said there are risk associated with saying what you want out loud because then you have to hold yourself accountablevan wagenen hasnt been shy about maintaining dialogue with his former coworkers and their client since taking the mets job he ha courted fresh perspective including hiring the espn broadcaster jessica mendoza another caa client to help with player evaluation a she travel around the major for television the move drew attention both good and bad but he considered her to be another innovative addition to a collection of staff member he billed a the best and the brightesta more traditional member of his front office david wright who became a special adviser to van wagenen after retiring last fall quickly learned his bos wa willing to discus nearly anythingsome day im like hey brodie ive got to take my daughter to preschool ive got to go can you wrap this up wright said i think he just love talking the gameone of the first call van wagenen made when the mets hired him wa to pete alonso the team top prospect they arranged to meet at los sombrero a mexican cantina in scottsdale ariz that alonso chose alonso then wa in arizona for the fall star game and had yet to log an inning in the majorsthat wa part of the reason for dinner despite hitting home run between class aa binghamton and class aaa la vega alonso did not get called up to queen in september the mets were out of the playoff race but the front office reluctance to call him up centered on the manipulation of alonso major league service time so the mets could control his future longerin arizona alonso ate lamb adobo a he listened to van wagenen who told him he wanted to be a bridge between player and managementextending that branch wa very meaningful said alonso who made the opening day roster after a stellar camp huge reallyshortly after

understanding of the player mindset will be an advantage when im communicating internally here van wagenen saidafter he crossed over to management however an extension for degrom wa one of the few

connie mack stadium in philadelphia the phillies were coasting to the world series it seemed leading the national league by six and a half game with to playbut in the sixth inning of a scoreless tie with the cincinnati red the phillies did not notice what the boy from havertown pa had picked up the runner on third chico ruiz wa itching to steal homei looked at my father and i said dad look how faroff the base that guy is he gon na go home middleton said last sunday in his office at the phillies training complex and the next pitch he went home i mean it wa really obvious to me he just had this extraordinary lead we were devastatedthe rest is seared in the psyche of every phillies fan of middleton generation starting with ruizs dash the phillies lost game in a row to blow the pennant it took them more year to win their first world series and another to win their next championship they have not had a winning season since the year before bryce harper then just reached the major league with the washington nationalsmore than half a century later middleton the phillies managing partner ha turned to harper now a sixtime allstar to lead them back on march middleton signed harper to a year million contract the longest richest freeagent deal in major league historyit wa not the most expensive deal of this offseason mike trout the millville nj native whom harper had tried to recruit to the phillies ha since signed a year million contract extension with the los angeles angel but harper contract a a partnership between two party with no prior relationship represents baseball most lucrative leap of faith for middleton it wa an opportunity he could not resisti approach my job a a fan first said middleton who sold his family tobacco business to altria the parent company of philip morris usa for billion in the day i stop thinking like a fan the day i stop feeling that im a fan thats the day i need to retirenow of course middleton ha the kind of perk he could only dream about in when he watched the phillies win the world series from the distant level above right field at veteran stadium to complete the harper deal middleton the team control person since flew to la vega on his private jet with his wife leigh and met for several hour with harper and his wife kaylait wa a deeply personal conversation the middleton talked about their year marriage and the challenge of balancing work and family the harper who met in high school asked about hospital and school they might need when they have child harper said he wa struck by the way middleton looked him in the eye showing an understanding that harper goal for this deal made it a life decision not just a baseball oneunderstand that my family mean the world to me my wife my mom and dad everybody said harper who had no interest in an optout clause i want to be able to sit there and have my kid grow up somewhere not have to move around and go here and go there when that time come for me this is an opportunity to play somewhere for year and try to understand a city and be into a city and be part of it thats the greatest thing that could ever happenmiddleton is the team most powerful link to it own history the team president andy macphail general manager matt klentak manager gabe kapler and all of the coach were hired from elsewhere with no tie to a proud provincial city institutional memory is important in philadelphia and middleton ha iti think philadelphia fan probably feel that john middleton one of their own said mike schmidt the greatest player in phillies history he one of our people one of our guyscan harper be a philly guy too growing up in la vega he said his father ron set an example a an ironworker that now help him relate to his new homemy dad wa blue collar harper said he worked from in the morning til in the afternoon he grinded every single day it wa take your freaking lunch pail to work and do your job i grew up in a family like that and if i can be around people like that and my family can be around people like that then theyll grow up the right wayas well a harper connected with middleton and embraced the idea of playing in philadelphia he had other interest he wanted a contract that would eclipse what wa then the richest on record giancarlo stanton year million deal and middleton emotional tie to his hometown team made him just the kind of owner harper agent scott boras needed for such an investmentas datasavvy team increasingly keep emotion from their decisionmaking turning instead to formulaic offer based on cold data agent have found it harder to appeal to owner personal drive the frenzy of old with multiple team bidding aggressively on free agent ha evolved to a painstaking process that often bleeds deep into spring trainingso an owner like middleton stand out to boras who also paired starter jake arrieta with the phillies last march on a three year million contract in his conversation with harper middleton mentioned the time he lost a high school wrestling championship on a referee bad callhe basically personalized his competitiveness boras said whats funny is that when owner have this dynamic people inside the game are concerned about it but what it doe is it actually increase winning and it also increase businesslook at what bryce harper done for philadelphiahe ha indeed had an effect before even playing a game the phillies who started this decade ranked first in the national league in attendance dropped to th of team last season at million total fan in the eight day after the harper news broke they sold ticket the apparel company fanatic said harper set a record for any sport for firstday jersey sale playstation quickly applied an image of harper in a phillies jersey to the cover of the video game mlb the show he like a rockstar baseball player schmidt said from middleton standpoint or his marketing people standpoint this kid ha an aura about him that mike trout doesnt now mike trout number may dwarf his but this kid sell stuff he had a pretty good career and agewise experiencewise he coming into his heyday right now i think thats what the phillies are banking onas significant a the offfield benefit may be middleton insists he signed harper solely to win a long a that happens he said the fan will respond middleton had declared his intention in november when he told usa today he wa prepared to spend money in free agency and maybe even be a little stupid about it the comment wa calculated middleton said to put public pressure on klentak and his staffklentak wa hired after the phillies posted the major worst record in they lost game across the next two year and ruined a promising season by limping down the stretch to an finish middleton wa tired of losing arrieta said and eager to raise expectationsour owner are very smart business people klentak said referring also to the buck family which like middleton owns percent of the phillies they understand timing and they understand the nature of baseball and theyve been incredibly supportive of our process over the last few year but always encouraging u to explore opportunity that will speed thing upklentak found those opportunity this winter he added shortstop jean segura left fielder andrew mccutchen reliever david robertson and catcher j t realmuto before spring training the only task remaining to cap an extraordinary winter wa signing a premier free agent manny machado or harpermachado signed with the san diego padre on feb for year and million more than the phillies had wanted to pay him by then middleton had met with boras in clearwater when he possibly became the first owner ever to say these five word to baseball most powerful agent i dont care about moneyive made enough money in my life middleton recalled telling boras the only reason im talking to you about bryce is that i believe he a special player who can help u win and get my bleeping trophy back our bleeping trophythat echoed middleton command to the slugger ryan howard in in the visiting clubhouse in the bronx after the phillies had ceded their world series title to the yankee asked about his vision for harper though middleton modified his message slightlyof course he craves a moment like the one he had last february when he watched his beloved eagle win the super bowl from a suite with their owner jeffrey lurie but more than that middleton want the harper deal to herald a new era he want the phillies his team in his town to be the model franchisethats what id like middleton said i look at people all the time in this organization and i just say why shouldnt we be great advertisement

called up in july he had plate appearance that summer nearly all a a pinchhitter or lateinning replacementit wasnt the role hed envisioned but it wa the role he got good pinchhitters are hard to find wilkins said it difficult to succeed in that role you have to understand that your rate of failure is going to be extremely highthese player usually need to find a specific role on a team in order to stay there i had clear reason why team were claiming me hassan said in a telephone interview from the twin camp in fort myers fla i got on base a lot and i wa good against lefthanded pitching it wa a niche skill setbut it wasnt enough to keep him with the a oakland designated hassan for assignment at the end of spring training and he wa picked up by four more team before the end of the season but never made it back to the majorsbrice who had control issue early in his career amusingly appealed to the marlin because of his ability to throw strike the club also liked that his size suggests potential durabilitybut in order to make the team on opening day he will need to improve his number against lefthanded hitter in lefty hit against him and had an onbase average of compared to and against rightiesduring a recent bullpen session marlin manager don mattingly the former lefthanded great for the yankee stood at the plate against brice and gave him feedback on what a lefthanded batter see when facing himyou never know when a discussion like that is going to resonate with a player said mel stottlemyre jr the marlin pitching coach it doesnt mean their stuff get nastier it just mean they change their thinking and that can make a big differencein eight appearance this spring brices era is a stellar and his strikeout rate is a high a it ever been stottlemyre ha noticed an urgency about him that he seen before in player who have gotten stuck in baseball virtual teamexchange program sometimes you can give those guy thing a little earlier than you would another player and hope that lightning strike in a bottle he saidundoubtedly brice is hoping for the same thingadvertisement

watching the los angeles dodger play the san diego padre at dodger stadiumthe ball sizzled over protective netting and into her logelevel seat behind home plate her daughter jana brody compared it to a bullet from a guni would love to see higher net brody said in a telephone interview tuesday the trajectory of the ball can only get hit so far until it start to arc and come down and then be a more manageable ball to catch or whatever but where she wa sitting there wa no chance for it to lob over it wa a straight shotbrody who wa not with her parent at the game said that she and her family were in shock after the accident a the month went by she wondered why the story had not come out no telecast had followed the flight of the fatal foul ball which wa hit by a padre batter during a tense ninth inning the dodger had not publicized the accident and the family had not contacted the news mediabut a brody researched fan injury she noticed an article published last spring that mentioned only one known instance of a fan being killed by a foul ball yearold alan fish also at dodger stadium in the only other reported death of fan involving a ball occurred in when a man wa hit by an overthrown ball from the fieldbrody contacted the author of the piece willie weinbaum of espn to add her mother name to the grim listgoldblooms death first reported by weinbaum on monday occurred during the first season in which all stadium in major league baseball had netting that extended at least to the far edge of each dugout but that netting did not protect goldbloom who sat in section row c seat on the level beneath the press box behind home platei realized it wa our responsibility to tell brody said nobody knew that wa important to me to get just the awareness out yes the netting got widened but it didnt go vertical and that would have been a huge change for my mom if it went up toowhen asked if the dodger might extend the netting to protect fan on the loge level where goldbloom wa seated joe jareck the dodger senior director for public relation said the team would not comment beyond a statement that expressed sympathy for goldbloom it said the matter ha been resolved between the team and the familythe injury wa not publicly disclosed at the time because the dodger generally do not make public report of accident that take place at dodger stadium the team said in a statement we avoid doing so out of respect for the privacy of the person involved in the accident and their familiesmajor league baseball in a statement tuesday defended the safety of it ballpark by saying it had increased the inventory of protected seat the statement asserted that team were constantly evaluating the coverage and design of their ballpark netting though stopped short of recommending that the netting be raised like it is in japanyou can see right through the net so whats the big deal brody said i cant understand why it took so long for them to even widen itin december commissioner rob manfred issued recommendation to all team to install netting extending from the end of the dugout closest to the plate to within foot of the plate the dodger announced that day that they would comply but some team held out reluctant to alienate fan in expensive lowerlevel seatsthe yankee were one of those team but relented last january a few month after a foul ball severely injured a toddler behind the thirdbase dugout a disclaimer in place since and printed on the back of every ticket in major league baseball warns of the risk and danger inherent to the game and the possibility of injury from among other thing thrown or batted ballsbut baseball ha changed greatly since then and the risk of injury to spectator ha risen mainly from the construction of new stadium designed to bring fan closer to the actionaccording to a study published last year in the william mary law review fan sitting behind home plate are on average nearly percent closer to the action at a major league game than they were year ago and the average amount of foul territory ha decreased by the same amount that reduces fan reaction time in an era that also feature bigger faster and stronger playersbrody said she wa not sure which player hit the foul ball that killed her mother it doesnt matter she said but she would like baseball to improve the safety for fanswe dont want fan to have a false sense of security like were fine now the net are widened she said these guy hit ball hard and theyre throwing mileanhour pitchesshe said the warning on the ticket wa not enoughwe were laughing on the back of the ticket enter at your own risk is in tiny tiny print and then buy farmer john hot dog is in like point font she said i mean stuff like that is kind of ridiculous too youd think that the warning label would be larger than the advertisementbrody said that the dodger had reached out to her family but she had agreed not to disclose the nature of their conversationsbrody said she would like to see baseball set up a fund for fan and their family who endure injury or the death of a loved one at a game instead of just saying sorry youre liable enter at your own riskafter goldbloom wa struck she began to experience weakness on her left side and wa taken by ambulance to a hospital according to the los angeles county coroner report at the hospital doctor discovered a brain hemorrhage and she underwent surgery her health deteriorated and she died at am on aug brody who life in santa barbara calif said her father would not be renewing his season

his skill were declining but he believed he deserved more than the threeyear million deal he ultimately signed during a heated exchange with yankee general manager brian cashman that wa later detailed in a sport illustrated article jeter asked cashman which shortstop he would rather haveone player cashman listed troy tulowitzki who nine year later will indeed be patrolling shortstop for the yankee on opening dayi remember the story said tulowitzki now after a recent spring training workout i heard it but it is what it is you see a gm trying to do his job at the time i wa going pretty goodhe certainly wa but so much ha happened sincejeter of course retired after the season and is now a part owner and chief executive of the miami marlin he wa replaced at shortstop by didi gregorius who ha grown into a standout at the positiontulowitzki is not the same player he wa in when he wa with the colorado rockies and considered one of the best player in baseball because of his play at the plate and in the field it wa the first of his five allstar seasonsbut a long list of injury hampered a large chunk of tulowitzkis prime year from to tulowitzki averaged just game a seasonthe last two year have been more trying because of a fractured right ankle in and surgery to remove bone spur from both heel in tulowitzkis last major league game wa july it took it toll he said but im still here standing and feel good i cant wait to prove myselftulowitzki ha played with an edge his whole career and he speaks his mind a he did after the rockies surprised him with a blockbuster trade to the blue jay in or after facing toronto which released him this offseason because they thought it wa unlikely he would be a healthy aboveaverage shortstop againtulowitzki hit a home run in his first spring training atbat a a yankee on feb against the blue jay no le and screamed toward his old team dugout while rounding the basesthat wa the biggest spring training homer ive ever hit he said then with a smile anybody who tell you youre done youre going to have some little extra firethat excitement ha since faded against the harsh reality that tulowitzki ha not faced major league pitching in a long time it is just spring training but tulowitzki is for with two home run and strikeout yankee manager aaron boone still maintains confidence that tulowitzkis timing will come aroundhell get there boone said im convinced of thattulowitzkis path to the yankee and his connection to jeter through gregorius make for a long winding story had gregoriuss right elbow ligament not torn last fall and required tommy john surgery tulowitzki would not be here had the blue jay not released tulowitzki in december after several frustrating season the yankee would have pursued other option on the trade or freeagent market or leaned more heavily on gleyber torres a yankee second baseman last year at shortstopbut the ligament did tear and toronto did release him so now nearly a decade after cashman said tulowitzkis name to jeters face tulowitzki is herei want a respectful and honest relationship with our player cashman said adding later the answer i provided back then wa an answer to an if you had access to everything and could do anything question it not disrespectful but at that time troy wa well recognized a the best shortstop in the gamethat wa not the case this offseason soon after the blue jay released tulowitzki with million remaining on his contract tulowitzkis agent paul cohen arranged a workout on dec it wa at long beach state where tulowitzki once starred and more than a dozen team attended including the yankeesvideo of the session captivated cashman who called cohen to request an additional private workout three day later tulowitzki who had the yankee on his list of preferred team wa taking ground ball in front of two top yankee scout the entire front office later viewed the more extensive video of a healthy tulowitzki moving with easeafter that we were all in cashman saidbut there wa competition because of a game suspension to shortstop addison russell the chicago cub aggressively pursued tulowitzki so did the los angeles angel who liked tulowitzki for third base others eyed tulowitzki for secondultimately even though gregorius is expected to return at some point this summer tulowitzki chose the yankeesive done a lot of thing in my career and ive been close but havent won a ring said tulowitzki who ha played in the playoff four time including a world series sweep by the boston red sox it wa strictly on that thats what im excited forthe negotiation were easy because the blue jay were on the hook for tulowitzkis million the yankee needed to offer only the major league minimum all that tulowitzki wanted on top of that a notrade clause unusual for a oneyear deal of that amounti want to be here and be here the whole time he saidthe yankee have eased tulowitzki through spring training with regular day off each week for his leg and plan to do the same during the regular season torres will play shortstop during those day and whenever gregorius return the yankee will have more to jugglehe look like he just being athletic and being himself yankee infielder dj lemahieu said of tulowitzki who wa also his teammate in colorado he look really good to metulowitzki is undoubtedly motivated to prove the blue jay wrong a well a those who thought he would never play again after his injury he said he wanted to show that older player could overcome hard time and still contributebut what guided him more than anything during the long repetitive day of rehabilitation wa his yearold son taz who doe not remember seeing his father play in the major league two year agoto get back out there and have him see me again wa what i thought about each and every day tulowitzki saidbeginning on march tulowitzki will have the chance when he wa growing up in california tulowitzki watched the yankee and later wore the same no jersey because

on sunday according to a source with knowledge of the talk where it wa established that the a could offer him a larger majorleague contract murray entered the draft in order to learn more what nfl front office think of him the source saidlate last year murray and his baseball agent scott boras insisted that the plan wa for murray to play one season a oklahoma starter and then report to spring training for the athletics such a deal wa apparently part of the negotiating process that led to murray baseball contract and wa outlined in a news conference last spring with a executivesstill that murray would even entertain the possibility of playing both big league baseball and quarterback on sunday or would be so selfassured of his talent a to make leveraging one against the other a plausible ploy is something new in american sportswhen bo jackson and deion sander were twosport star two decade ago they were a running back and a cornerback those are differencemaking position but quarterback they are notand in after charlie ward won the heisman playing quarterback at florida state he said he would turn to basketball unless he wa picked in the nfl draft first round when he wa not he embarked on a decadelong career in the nba mostly with the knicksthe difference between the two pastime must have seemed blurrier then free agency wa only dawning in the nfl many revelation concerning the toll of repeated hit to the head were still year into the futurenowadays we know how dangerous football can be but we also know that young baseball player face many year of some combination of playing in the minor league and making lowish salary under team control before hitting an ostensibly open market into which franchise are seemingly pouring le money every year all this while franchise quarterback sign deal worth million a year after finishing rookie contract that are not exactly ungenerousfootball versus baseball in other word is not the obvious clearcut decision that some might have once thought it wasit is conceivable that murray will not have to choose he is frequently projected a a firstround nfl draft pick and already wa one in baseball firstround pick are among the most valuable asset in both league and no team in either would knowingly waste one by using it on someone with no intention of trying to live up to iteither way murray ha already transcended the teamfirst ethos of both sport exploiting his moment of utmost possibility for all it is worth this might be the ultimate millennial move always always play your card optimally and you will maximize your accomplishmentsthen again an older person even an older millennial might point out that money fame and glamour are worth only so much in the long run we are all running on a treadmill no matter how fast our yard dash isthis much we know for sure should he not withdraw his entry into the nfl draft he will irrevocably give up his final season of eligibility in college

advertisementsupported byby james wagnertampa for all the power in the yankee lineup which smashed a major leaguerecord home run last season it lack the balance that is often a trademark of standout teamsthats because nearly all of the yankee powerhitting everyday player hit from the right side from aaron judge to giancarlo stanton to gary sanchez to miguel andujar and gleyber torresthat is particularly useful when squaring off against a lefthanded pitcher but when the yankee face a righthander this season the only lefthanded batter in the lineup might be outfielder brett gardner and aaron hick a switchhitter at least that might be the case until the return this summer of the lefthandedhitting shortstop didi gregorius who is still rehabilitating from tommy john surgeryto have such an overload of righthanded hitter is an intriguing departure for the yankee a franchise with a rich tradition of powerful lefthander from babe ruth to lou gehrig to yogi berra to roger mari to the switchhitting mickey mantle and more recently to robinson cano and to the switchhitters bernie williams and mark teixeirathey regularly took advantage of the short porch in right field of the old yankee stadium or the new one a such loading up the yankee lineup with powerful lefthanded hitter ha long seemed like a given until now anyway which is just fine with general manager brian cashmanthe balance in the lineup is vitally important cashman said but not at the expense from my perspective of the best player on the board especially if those player posse the ability to go the other way with powerin other word cashman and the rest of his front office are confident that their collection of mostly righthanded batter accentuated by the absence of gregorius will not be a weakness in with a similar lineup last season the yankee posted an onbaseplussluggingpercentage against lefthanded pitcher trailing only the houston astros for the best mark in baseball but there wa little dropoff for the yankee when they faced righthanded pitching a ops that wa the fourth best in the major leaguesin a perfect world youd have a bunch of guy that hit and hit for power and hit from both side of the plate and you can balance them perfectly yankee manager aaron boone said but that doesnt always exist id rather have better player than acquiring someone because he hit from a certain side of the platea lineup of hitter on the same side of the plate could be a welcoming sight for opposing manager who would face fewer matchup issue with their bullpen but it help the yankee that some of their best righthanded batter clearly can handle both lefthanded and righthanded pitching andujar the runnerup for the american league rookie of the year award last season and judge each posted an ops over last season against righthanded pitchersive always faced righties growing up judge said i didnt see too many lefty coming up a a kid so for me i feel more comfortable facing righthanded pitcher lefty it a little icing on the cakeone of cashmans mentor wa gene michael who wa a general manager of the yankee in the s and then again in the s michael prioritized lefthanded power hitter to take advantage of dimension in the old yankee stadium the rightfield wall wa foot from home platealthough the yankee officially list the dimension of the new yankee stadium which opened in a being identical to the one in the old stadium some evidence suggests that the wall in rightcenter field in the new ballpark is le curved and a somewhat moreinviting target for a righthanded batter hitting the ball the opposite wayballs hit the opposite way with power are still likely to travel a shorter distance than ball pulled with power so even shaving a few foot in rightcenter field help all those righthanded yankee hitter hitting to right fieldor a cashman put it i used to be a big believer in those big lefthanded air monster because of right field but in the new ballpark rightcenter field isnt a deep it just play completely different so it ok to have righthanded piece that can still go the other way to take advantageof the yankee home run last season were hit to right field of those nearly half were hit by righthanded batter according to fangraphs almost double the next team in that category the oakland athleticsseventeen of stanton home run last season were to right and rightcenter field judge ha hit nearly a many home run in his career to right and rightcenter a to left and leftcenter fieldin explaining the team current lack of lefthanded hitter cashman also pointed to the explosion of defensive shift on the right side of the infield over the last decade he cited brian mccann and teixeira a lefthanded power hitter who saw their batting average drop significantly because of the shiftswhen they got to the yankee and a the shift became more prevalent there le real estate in right field to play with he said so now these pullheavy lefthanded hairy monster are getting reduced because the shift are so effectivegregorius of course is a factor in the current imbalance hitting from the left side he had home run and had a ops last season in his absence tulowitzki who ha a proven ability to hit the ball all over the field is expected to be his main replacementone potential wild card in all this is greg bird who ha lefthanded power but hit just in and ha dealt with significant injury each of the past three season in the battle to win the first basemans job out of spring training luke voit ha a leg up because of how he helped the yankee down the stretch last season and voit too is righthandedgardner said having more lefthanded hitter in the lineup would give him a chance to see how a rival pitcher would attack him a a game progress but with the current litany of data and video on opponent he said there wa no excuse for a lack of preparationit doesnt matter where im at in the lineup or who is hitting behind me it doesnt change a whole lot

fulfill his dream of becoming one of baseball elite third basemen he need to keep watching and emulatingandujar who turned on saturday want to field like nolan arenado alex bregman and manny machado and more than anything he want to be like his hero adrian beltre another third baseman who recently retired after a distinguished year career that included five gold glove and four allstar appearancesi love the way he throw the ball and position himself on defense andujar said in spanish after a recent afternoon at the yankee spring training site and how he prepares before a pitch in the ready position and with a little hopthere are several reason the yankee did not seriously pursue machado during his highprofile free agency they wanted to spread money around on various improvement rather than spending in a single chunk and machados year million contract with the san diego padre proved to be the secondlargest freeagent deal in north american sport historybeyond money there wa also the fact that the team already possessed a talented young third baseman in andujar who finished second in the american league rookie of the year voting last season despite his defensive wartswe recognize there are player playing all around the game that might be better than what we have here but thats fine too yankee general manager brian cashman said recently you cant have them allhe added later the product is a strong one and we want it to be the best it possibly can be if it not good enough judge me on my recommendation to ownershipand long before the yankee decided not to formally make an offer to machado they were already working to improve andujars defenseandujars talent particularly at the plate is undeniable and wa so even a early a when he signed with the yankee at out of his native dominican republic last season the yankee had planned to have brandon drury at third base but andujar took over the job through a combination of injury to others and his own performancein game andujar posted an onbaseplusslugging percentage and hit topped only by the washington national star anthony rendon among major league third baseman andujars homer and run batted in trailed only giancarlo stanton on the yankeesbut in the field andujar wa shaky while he committed error and last year al gold glove winner at the position oakland matt chapman wa charged with andujar struggled in other regard advanced defensive metric rated him the worst fielding third baseman among those with at least inning last season in the doordie game of the al divisional series against the boston red sox yankee manager aaron boone opted for neil walker at third base instead of andujarhe exceeded his developmental projection on defense especially cashman said of andujar we just have to give him time and be patient and give him the chance to close those gap the old adage of where there a will there a way and he ha a lot of willso to enact all the desired change for this season the yankee and andujar recognized that he needed extra instruction over the wintera month after the yankee were knocked out of the playoff by the red sox in october andujar spent a few day with boone and the yankee infield instructor carlos mendoza both former infielder at the yankee complex in tampaafterward andujar returned to the dominican republic and continued his offseason training with private trainer to improve his agility in january mendoza and boone on a trip to see several yankee player worked with andujar at the yankee academy and checked on his progressthe yankee zeroed in on two area for andujar how he throw the ball and how he us his feetthey saw that andujar had a tendency to throw sidearm that is fine when charging a chopping ground ball or throwing from an awkward angle but on routine play the yankee believed it wa affecting his accuracy sidearm throw can sail to the side a they approach first baseso the yankee have continually reminded andujar to set his foot properly and throw the more traditional overhand way on routine play which he did with ease during pregame fielding drill even last yearits about comfort level for him mendoza said so when the game started he got away from it but now we want that work that he doing before game to show in game this yearin term of refining andujars footwork the yankee taught him not only to get into an athletic position at third base bent at the knee and hand out ready to field but to make a slight hop on the ball of his foot before each pitch is delivered mendoza likened it to a tennis player waiting to receive a servewe talk about guy hand all the time but really the great fielder have great foot and are able to keep athletic and create hop for themselves boone saideven something a small a a little bounce can be significantitll help the accuracy of his first step mendoza said last year he wa a step too late a tick of a second in the big league thats the difference between an out and a double past youwillie randolph a longtime yankee second baseman and coach who serf a a guest spring training instructor said young player sometimes had mental lapse in which they forgot to be in an athletic fielding position on every single pitch and were caught flatfooted when the ball wa hit their wayafter a recent workout in spring training randolph commended andujars progressthe difference i see from this year to last year he starting to dance now he said he starting to feel the rhythm of the positionmuch a cashman and mendoza did randolph advocated patience with andujar he pointed to the yankee win last season despite andujars defensive lapse and said that the total might improve a his fielding did how much if at all will be a question hovering over the seasoni always have trusted in my work and i thank the team for believing in me and my talent although i havent been here long andujar said im thankful to be here and to show them every day that i can do itperhaps more than anyone andujar want the narrative about him to change the skepticism hovering over his defense ha persisted so much since last season that he occasionally look a tad annoyed answering more question about it this spring he answer them nonethelessyet the day after arenado who could have been a yankee freeagent target next winter agreed to an eightyear million extension with the colorado rockies andujar smiled when

shall not be described involving one william joseph buckner i wept slept and awoke a gloomy pessimist forever haunted by the fall of mani became a football fan around the same time and i figured i should root for the patriot a well in new england solidarity they had recently played albeit embarrassingly badly in a super bowl so i wa unaware of their long distinguished legacy of lousy play but by the time i turned and they were working their way through a season with a encore just around the corner i understood a little better the implication of my choicethis combination of red sox tragedy and patriot futility defined my relationship to professional sport until adulthood at which point a you may have heard absolutely everything changed for both team and they became insufferably dominant and my fandom forged in suffering and melodrama and wait till next year rue never quite recovered from my favorite team successeveryone leaf certain childish thing behind of course but there is no greater chasm in the remembered continuity of the self than the gulf separating me from the version of myself whose mind wa at least percent baseball from february until october and percent football for the rest of the year who screamed and raved my way through crucial game and crucial month and who once talked a bos into letting me off work early because of the psychic damage inflicted by aaron boone soxcrushing american league championship serieswinning home run the prior nighti remember that person but i cant remember how he felt and trying to raise my child to be new england sport fan in an age of constant new england winning ha given me real sympathy with the lukewarmly religious the christmasandeaster sort of believer who want to impart some measure of piety to their child without really experiencing the flame of faith themselvesthere are reason besides bostonian sport success for the dying of that flame my current editor probably wouldnt let me out of column writing after a devastating loss and normal adult obligation leave le time for rereading roger angells seasonrecapping baseball essay for the th timebut the frequent triumph of the sox and pat have been crucial to my loss of ardor in the old day i wa always mystified about how yankee fan stirred up the same excitement year after year despite their constant winning and a my team became increasingly yankeelike the mystification remained indeed i missed the thirst enough to seek the feeling elsewhere adopting longsuffering franchise temporarily until the kansa city royal ruined our affair by winning the world series to remind myself of what it wa like to nourish longunrequited hopesdespite that infidelity though ive never taken the step of actually rooting against one of my childhood team which ha kept me connected to both of them however dutifullyand now that the patriot have ground their way in a terribletowatch game highlighted by punt to yet another super bowl victory i want to report a change in my sport psychology in my dutiful connection to the latest run of patriot super bowl appearance i have begun to feel something different strange and unfamiliar not a recovery of the old romance but a growing appreciation of pure ruthless effectiveness an admiration for iron efficiency a joy at the dismantling of highly touted rival a feeling that almost almost make me begin to have a trace of a scintilla of understanding for what it feel like to be a yankee fani say this a someone who feel no particularly personal sympathy or affection for the two men bill belichick and tom brady who have delivered the patriot their extraordinary dynasty belichick is an unpleasant perfectionist whose cultivated public misanthropy and look at me a slob outfit often seem like an irritating sort of performance art brady preferred the supermodel charm of gisele bündchen to bridget moynahan the nice catholic exgirlfriend i saw them at mass together once so im totally in her camp who wa carrying his child and then succumbed via gisele to a proathlete equivalent of the gwyneth paltrowgoop worldviewand without delving into the arcanum of deflategate it obvious that the patriot search for a competitive edge ha taken them to at least the edge of you know cheatingso the old fakepersonal bond that i felt for my flawed new england hero yaz nomah bledsoe isnt there with brady and belichick today what is there and increasingly a their dynasty ha become more improbably extended is something very different a zest for onfield excellence simply for it own sake a forgiveness of personal and even moral deficiency because the record speaks for itself a setting aside of feelgood narrative and romantic underdog story because the sheer force of winning trump them alloh did someone say trump yes it appropriate that the patriot are donald trump favorite team but not because they have too many white player or because their consistent grinding rigorous success somehow resembles his improbable and often ridiculous ascent rather it because the patriot are the actual thing that his grifter instinct and great again sloganeering are constantly trying to evoke a dependably reliably excellent american institution of the kind that people in the previetnam era took for granted and that our own era struggle to reproducethe patriot are to football what the apollo and manhattan project were to militaryindustrialcomplex science what ibm and general motor were to big business what the hoover dam and mount rushmore were to public work with belichick a their pattonmeetseisenhower impresario by turn a jerk and a bore but a winner above all they are a throwback a constant rebuke to the decadence visible in every other american institution their first fan white house very much included a last bloom of the cando genius that won u world war ii sorry getting a little carried away here the point is that unlike my beloved red sox who now win just often enough to make me feel some catholicwithcalvinistancestors guilt over their success the patriot have over the last few year passed into new territory a new sphere of fan experience for the first time since i wa in college and they were scrappy underdog their every victory make me want them to win more to boldly go like neil armstrong and james t kirk where no team ha gone before sorry carried away again the point the point is that i am a changed fan or at least a changing one with every patriot victory i am winning the victory over myself i am shedding old habit jettisoning the underdoggery and romance of my childhood learning to love dynastic rulethe super bowl is over but next season is coming brady isnt retiring belichick is going back to his tape and plot and scheme six super bowl ring

advertisementsupported byby james wagnera rough start to the season got significantly worse for the yankee on monday in a surprising announcement in the morning the alreadybruised yankee placed their star outfielder giancarlo stanton on the injured list with a left biceps strain then minute before the start of a win over the detroit tiger on monday night the team announced that third baseman miguel andujar had joined the list with a right shoulder injury that might require a seasonending operationstanton a crucial power hitter and andujar the american league rookie of the year runnerup last season exhibited no obvious sign of injury during a seasonopening series loss to the lowly baltimore oriolesandujar hurt his shoulder while sliding back into third base in the fourth inning of sunday loss to the oriole but he finished the game reporting no problem scheduled to be off on monday he visited the trainer room to have the shoulder checked and then wa sent for a magnetic resonance imaging exam which revealed a torn labrumyankees manager aaron boone said the team would try therapy for andujar and then reevaluate his shoulder in a couple of week to see if surgery seemed necessaryhis physical test with the doctor is really good so there is some optimism that treated conservatively he can respond and come back and play boone said but well know that in a couple weeksin his absence the yankee will lean on dj lemahieu at third base and they have called up the utility man tyler wade from class aaa scrantonwilkesbarrethe list of key yankee who are either injured or still returning from injury now contains eight player stanton andujar shortstop didi gregorius outfielder aaron hick and jacoby ellsbury and pitcher dellin betances c c sabathia and luis severino in that group there are a combined allstar appearance one cy young award winner sabathia and one most valuable player stantonits unfortunate right now stanton said before the game but i guess it better to be in the beginning than at the end of the yearstanton played every inning of the oriole series in left field and wa for at the plate with four strikeout and seven walk he later revealed that he felt discomfort while swinging during a thirdinning atbat on the chilly sunday eveninghe considered alerting yankee coach but instead chalked it up to a cramp when the tightness in his arm persisted after the game and he started thinking it had affected the quickness of his swing stanton informed the teama magnetic resonance imaging examination revealed a grade strain the mildest on a scale of three so stanton will be shut down for day and according to boone could return at any point this monthi dont like it at all stanton said just worked for six week to get here plus the offseason id much rather this wouldve popped in spring training but thats where were at i dont have to start from scratch when i come backstill a the injury have piled up during spring training and in the early day of the season the yankee depth ha been getting a stiff early testpeople asked me all spring how i like the team and i tell people i love the team not just because of the guy we have in the room but the depth that we have outfielder brett gardner said obviously were not expecting to get that depth tested this early on but here we are april and already making move guy will just have to step up and get the job doneagainst the tiger the remaining yankee provided victory domingo german a rotation fillin provided five stout inning while catcher gary sanchez and gardner each homeredbetances may be among the first of the injured yankee to return this month a boone said he wa progressing well after shoulder inflammation late in spring training sabathia who is serving a fivegame suspension stemming from an episode in which he threw at tampa bay jesus sucre in a game last fall is also expected back this month once his suspension end sabathia will move to the il since he is a few week behind his fellow starting pitcher because of offseason operation on his heart and kneeseverino is expected back from a shoulder injury in may and gregorius is expected to return from tommy john surgery sometime during the summer it is unclear when ellsbury who missed all of the season and wa originally expected to be ready for spring training could be ready for the major league since he is still recovering from hip surgery last year and a flareup of a foot ailmenthickss nagging back injury ha improved recently but it required two cortisone shot he ha been out since march and ha not yet resumed baseball activity i dont think it going to be deep into the season by any mean but he still got some week to go boone saidthe yankee once had six outfielder on the roster but now three are on the il their outfield option now consist of aaron judge clint frazier who wa also called up from scrantonwilkesbarre on monday michael tauchman who wa acquired in a trade just before the season began and gardnerboone said frazier would play frequently in stanton absence frazier once a top prospect who missed most of last season with a concussion ha hit in limited opportunity in the major league over the past two year but made improvement to his swing this springadvertisement

advertisementsupported bykeeping scorethe oriole first baseman is for his last why is he still in the lineup a nobel prizewinning economist explains the flawed logic behind letting davis contract dictate his playing timeby benjamin hoffmanon sept chris davis who had been hitless in his last atbats got a changeup from white sox pitcher james shield and jumped on it davis lined the ball through the shift into right field hustling his way to second for a doublesince that day davis a yearold slugger for the baltimore oriole who once hit home run in a season ha known nothing but ignominy he went hitless in his final atbats of the season clinching the worst batting average for a qualified player in major league history on monday he made another dark entry into the record book after an for performance in baltimore win over oakland he reached consecutive atbats without a hit breaking the previous record of set by eugenio velez across the and seasonsthe extraordinary run of futility raise an obvious question why are the oriole still putting davis out in the field when reporter asked exactly that before monday game manager brandon hyde said he really wanted to play todayin truth the decision to keep playing davis almost certainly ha more to do with his million salary this year and the million the oriole owe him beyond in salary and deferred payment which will have the team sending him paycheck through the season considering the amount of money the team ha committed to davis his situation might be le suited for a manager like hyde than it is for someone like richard thaler the nobel prizewinning economist at the university of chicago booth school of business to thaler the oriole refusal to sideline davis is a classic example of the sunk cost fallacy an economic principle he detailed in his book misbehaving the making of behavioral economics a classic example is you order some dessert at a restaurant and it cost thaler said in a phone interview you take a couple bite and you realize you were already full and this dessert is really rich but you feel like you cant waste the whole thing so you eat more of it than you shouldideally thaler said the correct decision is to ignore any cost that ha already been paid and evaluate the situation strictly on it own merit one of his favorite illustration of sunk cost he said is deciding whether or not to attend a basketball game you had purchased ticket for even though attending would mean traveling through a blizzard the mistake people make is thinking that somehow using this player or eating that dessert or going to the game is getting some of that money back he said it not it just making you feel a little better about a purchase that turned out to be not a very good oneif the oriole are waiting for davis to pull out of his tailspin they are ignoring the fact that player are typically at their physical peak at around year old davis age in when his homer season inspired his million contract and then generally see a decline in performance in davis case there wa an immediate dip in before a brief resurgence in but in the threeplus season since he ha hit over atbats with an onbase plus slugging percentage of that adjusted for his home park is percent worse than league average in that periodunlike velez or the previous record holder bill bergen and dave campbell and craig counsell who each had an for streak davis is not staying in the lineup because of his glove he wa rated a a belowaverage fielder by sport info solution in each of the previous two season meaning he make his living almost entirely with his bat and yet in his last plate appearance his total offensive output ha consisted of six walk two rbi and strikeoutsdavis who ha occasionally been booed in baltimore this season received mostly encouragement from the fan at camden yard on monday a number that also set a team record for futility aside from a game in to which no fan were admitted hyde ha also continued to look for a silver lining no matter how cloudy thing gethe hit three ball on the nose he told reporter after monday game though none of that contact resulted in a hit so im taking that a a positive moving forward hopefully it a good startthaler channeling the statistician bill james correctly guessed that davis had been worth around minus win above replacement over the last two year baseball reference had him at minus last season and ha yet to release any number that figure compound the cost of the alreadybad deal davis and his negative value have been taking up a roster spot and playing time that could be given to a lowcost player from the minor league thaler acknowledged that while the concept of the sunkcost fallacy is an easy one for people to comprehend many will still convince themselves to ignore reality in the face of a hard decision and push forward despite the costin the case of sport team management may think that suppose they just cut him that theyre going to look like idiot he said of course whats true is playing him make them look like bigger idiotsthaler said he believed that if he were an owner he would congratulate a general manager willing to admit a mistake and move along from a bad dealbarring that he said davis example could be used for team to better understand how to approach large deal in the future if the team is one that will keep a player on the field no matter what then that team should avoid longterm deal but he said an owner willing to spend money a well a eat the cost if thing go south could be rewarded a it would offer potential benefit without a later compounding of errorsdavis did not play in tuesday loss to the athletics thaler belief the team best bet moving forward is to go one step further than benching him the team should cut davis and replace him with a minor leaguer a even a socalled replacement or near average player would represent a significant improvementthey could win let say two or three more game this year at a cost of half a million he said that would be the cheapest two or three win you could possibly buy that would be like adding a starbenjamin hoffman is a senior staff editor and regular
