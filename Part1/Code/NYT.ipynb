advice.by serena solomonany woman who ha ever carried and birthed a child , in whatever fashion , deserves her own espn highlight reel — blood , sweat , tear and the eventual triumph of holding her newborn baby . to be clear , childbirth isn ’ t a game . you can ’ t plead with the referee when you don ’ t like a call or leave the field when you ’ re tired . still , a a lifelong athlete , i saw childbirth , especially an unmedicated one , a the ultimate challenge of physical endurance , mental stamen and my ability to handle pain.when i became pregnant in january and set about preparing for the monumental task of birthing a human , i loaded up on prenatal vitamin , kept a daily routine of birthing stretch and exercise , and endured an eight-week birthing course . an image of the lead female competitor in the new york city marathon , who bring me to tear when they run past my brooklyn apartment each year , filled me with confidence for labor . washboard-like ab . lean leg showing off every strand of muscle . calm , focused and confident expression on their faces.however , a my due date came near , i clung to a fear of pain and the unknown out of my control . how long would my labor be ? would my mind fall apart ? what if my pelvis wasn ’ t the optimal shape or i stopped dilating ? i wanted to face childbirth with the same kind of confidence that radiated from the runner i admired . so i turned to sport psychology for advice.the field typically us a hodgepodge of method like cognitive behavioral therapy and attention control training to improve athletic performance and competitor experience . it suit a laboring woman because it can quickly provide practical tool to achieve a specific goal , said jay-lee nair , a singapore-based sport psychologist who work with athlete , including professional golfer and olympic sailor , a well a woman preparing for labor . a simple strategy could be mimicking an athlete ’ s pregame routine like reciting affirmation “ reminding them about their game plan or the attitude they want to have , ” she said.to help me labor like an olympian , dr. nair challenged my unhelpful birth belief with rational fact . in the sport context , an unhelpful thought could be “ believing a win in a tournament wa because of luck or lesser skilled competitor , ” she said.i have a fear of operation and for me , undergoing a cesarean would take more gut than an unmedicated labor . dr. nair advised me to gather positive cesarean story for a process called cognitive restructuring , in which fact-based alternative statement dispute the irrational belief . i wa under the impression that a mother could not pick up her child for six week after a cesarean , but many of my friend assured me that they could within days. “ it is hard just like a natural birth is hard , and you ’ re still amazing for going through that , ” dr. nair said.joan steidinger , a sport psychologist based in the bay area and a former ultramarathon runner , told me to develop a mindfulness plan by identifying the extremely difficult moment in labor — the -minute cab ride to the hospital under the onslaught of contraction topped my list — and to design a predetermined meditation for each . she used this strategy when she prepared runner for the western state -mile endurance run , in which the track go through canyon with stagnant -degree air . “ you might visualize a cool waterfall , something to take your mind off the situation , ” said dr. steidinger.i still wondered how athlete reframe their mind if something doesn ’ t go a planned mid-competition . how doe a figure skater shift from aiming for gold to finishing her four-minute routine with dignity when she doesn ’ t land a jump that took month of practice ? “ what we usually do is create some kind of action they do to refocus because an action connects mind and body , ” said caroline silby , a former figure skater turned sport psychologist . that could mean pushing down on the ice or drawing a deep breath to move beyond failure , dr. silby said.the physical cue i developed to help me reframe mid-labor started with clenched fist during an inhale and then opening them during an exhale , with my palm up in a surrender . i would surrender to the difficult moment or to whatever my body needed for a safe birth , whether that wa every intervention under the sun or nothing at all.the idea of pain with a purpose is common in sport and labor . so are breathing technique and visualization to cope . visualization didn ’ t do it for me , but breathing did . during my birth class , i figured out what i liked — a long , loud exhale where i focused on the vibrating hum inside my mouth . i practiced this a few time each week while holding a piece of ice ( it ’ s surprisingly painful ) . dr. silby added a tip : stay present and enjoy the rest between contraction , much a a marathon runner turn a downhill section into active recovery . “ if you ’ re anticipating the next painful push during recovery , that is a waste , ” she said.after an anxious and tearful day beyond my due date , contraction started on a monday evening . labor quickly became a familiar rhythm , not unlike my favorite workout of high-intensity interval training where , say , a minute of squat is followed by a -second break.by a.m. , my contraction were down to three minute apart , our cue to head to the hospital . excitement . anticipation . and then my labor stalled . i used my physical cue — releasing clenched fist — again and again to move beyond the disappointment.my mind held it together until around midday . why did my stupid body slow the contraction ? at the same physical and mental crossroad in a soccer match , i would have raised my hand for a substitution so a more energized teammate could finish what i started . but this wa labor . i wa the only one who could birth this baby.after some bleeding at p.m. , my obstetrician advised me to come into the hospital . i assumed i had hour left and that beautiful thought “ epidural ” appeared on the horizon . however , my body had other ideas.when i got in the cab , my contraction were minute apart . when i got out , the contraction were coming every two minute and my water had broken ( yes , in the cab ) . minute later i wa in a labor room . i pushed , the obstetrician pulled , my doula held my leg back and my mom propped my head up . it wa freeing to finally enlist some brute strength.after almost hour of labor , and half an hour of pushing , just minute after arriving at the hospital i had my slimy , alert and , at pound , ounce , very large son.the strategy borrowed from sport psychology got me somewhat gracefully through labor . but they are not foolproof . like serena williams at this year ’ s united state open final , even elite athlete have their trying moment . i did , too , just a i entered the homestretch of my labor.less than two week after the birth , i stood on the stoop to watch the new york city marathon , holding my sleepy newborn . the lead woman ran by at their cracking pace , elegant and forceful . a tunnel of spectator along the avenue celebrated them . a usual , i had tear in my eye . but this year , i felt that i wa in their elite league.serena solomon is an australian journalist based in new york.advertisement',

( the warrior currently play in oakland , but we ’ re counting them a san francisco ’ s basketball team and the san jose shark a the city ’ s hockey team , to be consistent with rooting pattern there
